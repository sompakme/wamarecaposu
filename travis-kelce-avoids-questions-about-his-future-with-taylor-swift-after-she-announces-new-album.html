As much as they understand and appreciate their fans' support, it's understandable that the power couple would get tired of having their private business be public discussion. Right now, they are both going through very important moments in their careers, with Taylor recently becoming the only artist in history to win the Album of the Year Grammy Award four times, and Travis getting ready to take the Chiefs to the Superbowl.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/all-of-taylor-swift-s-famous-exes-ranked-by-how-much-fans-loved-them-together-3.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>All Of Taylor Swift's Famous Exes, Ranked By How Much Fans Loved Them Together</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Taylor Swift has dated celebrities like Harry Styles, John Mayer and Calvin Harris, and her fans have plenty of thoughts about each relationship.</span><p>Recently, during a press conference, Travis Kelce was asked, not for the first time, about his future with Taylor Swift. Rumors have been going around about the couple getting engaged in the Superbowl, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he was asked point-blank if he was planning to propose</a>. "Is there going to be another ring besides the Super Bowl ring if you win this thing on Sunday?" a reporter questioned, to which the NFL player replied, "I’m focused on getting this ring, and that’s all that my mind’s focused on right now."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=travis-heard-the-new-taylor-swift-album-already---and-he-couldn-39-t-be-prouder>Travis Heard The New Taylor Swift Album Already - And He Couldn't Be Prouder</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/taylor-swift-mtv-video-music-awards-2023-1.jpg><p>Travis Kelce couldn't be prouder of how Taylor Swift is making history, and he's constantly in awe of everything she does. In the same press conference, he was asked about her triumphant night at the Grammys, and he couldn't help gushing, "She’s unbelievable. She’s rewriting the history books herself."</p><p>He also opened up about how her staggering success <a href=#>puts pressure on him to keep up with her</a> . "I told her I'll have to hold up my end of the bargain and come home with some hardware too."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He's not only proud of Taylor Swift's awards and record-breaking success, though. He's also incredibly happy about her new record, The Tortured Poets Department, and admitted that he's one of the few people who have had the privilege of having listened to some of the album already. The expectations are incredibly high, and according to Travis, they will absolutely be met. He said the album is "unbelievable," and that he "can’t wait for her to shake up the world when it finally drops."</p><p>Fans shouldn't worry about their favorite celebrity couple. Although it seems like it's been a long time, the truth is they have been together for less than a year. It's only natural that they wouldn't want to share so many details of their love life, but that doesn't mean they aren't going strong.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirq5mmnsBut8Slmp5lkau8qrDSZqiunaOptrC60madrqylp7JuwMCyo6iqXajEqrLTZpinpp%2Bqu6SxzJ6lrWWemsRurcubrKZn</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ftravis-kelce-avoids-questions-about-his-future-with-taylor-swift-after-she-announces-new-album.html&text=Travis%20Kelce%20Avoids%20Questions%20About%20His%20Future%20With%20Taylor%20Swift%20After%20She%20Announces%20New%20Album&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftravis-kelce-avoids-questions-about-his-future-with-taylor-swift-after-she-announces-new-album.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftravis-kelce-avoids-questions-about-his-future-with-taylor-swift-after-she-announces-new-album.html&title=Travis%20Kelce%20Avoids%20Questions%20About%20His%20Future%20With%20Taylor%20Swift%20After%20She%20Announces%20New%20Album" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ftravis-kelce-avoids-questions-about-his-future-with-taylor-swift-after-she-announces-new-album.html&title=Travis%20Kelce%20Avoids%20Questions%20About%20His%20Future%20With%20Taylor%20Swift%20After%20She%20Announces%20New%20Album" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ftravis-kelce-avoids-questions-about-his-future-with-taylor-swift-after-she-announces-new-album.html&title=Travis%20Kelce%20Avoids%20Questions%20About%20His%20Future%20With%20Taylor%20Swift%20After%20She%20Announces%20New%20Album" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftravis-kelce-avoids-questions-about-his-future-with-taylor-swift-after-she-announces-new-album.html&description=Travis%20Kelce%20Avoids%20Questions%20About%20His%20Future%20With%20Taylor%20Swift%20After%20She%20Announces%20New%20Album" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./what-american-traditions-come-from-germany.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What american traditions come from germany">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./savannah-chrisley-on-the-south-beach-diet-healthy-eating.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Savannah Chrisley on the South Beach Diet, Healthy Eating">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
