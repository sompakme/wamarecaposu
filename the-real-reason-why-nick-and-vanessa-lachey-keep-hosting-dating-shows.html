And while <a href=#>Nick may be cautious about doing a reality show about his romantic life again</a> (he’s doing one with his brother and former bandmate Drew instead), that hasn’t stopped the 98 Degrees crooner from venturing into the world of dating shows with his second wife. So far, the couple has been hosting the <a href=#>Netflix</a> reality series Love Is Blind and The Ultimatum: Marry or Move On.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>'The Ultimatum' Hosts Nick And Vanessa Lachey Also Had A Pre-Marriage Ultimatum</a></span></p><p>Nick and Vanessa have certainly been hit on both shows. Even participants on the shows have said that the celebrity couple tends to give good dating advice. That said, this doesn’t explain why Nick and Vanessa have become a fixture in dating shows in the last few years.</p><h2 id=nick-and-vanessa-lachey-have-an-interesting-love-story-themselves>Nick And Vanessa Lachey Have An Interesting Love Story Themselves</h2><p>They may not have met on a dating show, but one might say that Nick and Vanessa’s love story is just as colorful. For starters, <a href=#>the two first met when Nick was a guest on Vanessa’s show, TRL</a>. Interestingly, Nick was there to promote his reality show with then-wife Jessica Simpson called Newlyweds.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since then, the two kept running into each other. And because they were both with someone else back then, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nick and Vanessa just kept things friendly</a>. “It was always about business, and it was always nice to see him,” Vanessa recalled.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Does Nick Lachey Talk About His Ex-Wife Jessica Simpson?</a></span></p><p>After Nick split from Jessica in 2006, however, the singer tapped Vanessa to star in the music video for his new single What’s Left of Me. That’s when sparks flew.</p><p>“That’s what made it no longer friends and it got romantic,” Vanessa confessed. The TRL host also admitted that she was “so crushing” on Nick really hard that she didn’t even want to face him when he promoted the song on TRL. “I didn’t show up for work that day,” she recalled. “I called in sick.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Little did Vanessa know that Nick also felt like something was going on between them too.</p><p>“We’d started kind of talking, and I got to the studio fully expecting to be interviewed by her. Probably a little psyched to think I’d be interviewed by her — and instead it was Lala [Anthony],” the singer recalled.</p><p>“Not that I have anything against Lala, but I was like, ‘Oh, where’s Vanessa?’ And they were like, ‘Oh, she called in sick?’ And I was like, “Ah…here we go.”</p><p>Eventually, Nick and Vanessa started seeing each other and word got out about their romance rather quickly. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">This only made the situation awkward</a> for them since Nick had just broken up with his first wife and everything practically played out in front of the fans.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“He was literally in a very public marriage and a very public divorce, and I had to go through all that s*** very publicly, and it was very hard for us,” Vanessa explained. That’s when the couple decided they had to put each other first. “It wasn't until the moment that he was like, ‘I’m gonna let it go,’ and I said, ‘I’m gonna let it go,’ and we truly committed to each other.”</p><p>Nick and Vanessa eventually married in 2011. Since then, the couple has welcomed three children. And more recently, because of their shows on Netflix, they’ve also been working together more and more.</p><h2 id=so-why-do-nick-and-vanessa-lachey-keep-hosting-dating-shows>So, Why Do Nick And Vanessa Lachey Keep Hosting Dating Shows?</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It seems that the simple answer is that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">producers love them, especially Chris Coelen</a> who is behind Kinetic Content, the company that produces both Love is Blind and Ultimatum. “I love working with them,” he remarked. “They are fantastic hosts.”</p><p>At the same time, Coelen also loves the idea of bringing in a couple that has been together for so long and has gone through some relationship ups and downs themselves. That essentially makes Nick and Vanessa relationship experts. “They are very intuitive, and they are also very empathetic and willing to share and want the best for the couples,” he explained.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Much Are 'Love Is Blind' Hosts Nick And Vanessa Lachey Worth?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When it comes to Ultimatum, Coelen also thought of bringing Nick and Vanessa in since they can relate to what the couples on the show are going through. As Vanessa once revealed, she gave Nick an ultimatum herself after dating each other for five years.And while that resulted in a brief split, the pair eventually reconciled and got married.</p><p>After everything they’ve been through, Coelen knows that Nick and Vanessa have a lot of wisdom to share in the dating and relationship department.</p><p>“I think that in the environment existed with the ultimatum, sharing their own personal story was a way that they could provide learning and comfort and experience and maybe sort of a 30,000-foot view on this whole thing from some of the people who very close to this,” he explained.</p><p>“That's incredibly valuable to be able to get that impartial experience and insight and the fact that Nick and Vanessa were willing to be as open about it as they were was amazing and it is a testament to them.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Does Vanessa Lachey Make More Money For 'NCIS: Hawai'i' Or 'Love Is Blind'?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdo7akt4yvmKedo6iubrjAnJ%2BesV2Wv6Z5x6iqraGenHqlrdOipaBlo528uL%2BO</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fthe-real-reason-why-nick-and-vanessa-lachey-keep-hosting-dating-shows.html&text=The%20Real%20Reason%20Why%20Nick%20And%20Vanessa%20Lachey%20Keep%20Hosting%20Dating%20Shows&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-real-reason-why-nick-and-vanessa-lachey-keep-hosting-dating-shows.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-real-reason-why-nick-and-vanessa-lachey-keep-hosting-dating-shows.html&title=The%20Real%20Reason%20Why%20Nick%20And%20Vanessa%20Lachey%20Keep%20Hosting%20Dating%20Shows" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fthe-real-reason-why-nick-and-vanessa-lachey-keep-hosting-dating-shows.html&title=The%20Real%20Reason%20Why%20Nick%20And%20Vanessa%20Lachey%20Keep%20Hosting%20Dating%20Shows" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fthe-real-reason-why-nick-and-vanessa-lachey-keep-hosting-dating-shows.html&title=The%20Real%20Reason%20Why%20Nick%20And%20Vanessa%20Lachey%20Keep%20Hosting%20Dating%20Shows" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-real-reason-why-nick-and-vanessa-lachey-keep-hosting-dating-shows.html&description=The%20Real%20Reason%20Why%20Nick%20And%20Vanessa%20Lachey%20Keep%20Hosting%20Dating%20Shows" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./these-jackie-chan-movies-made-an-absolutely-insane-amount-of-money.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="These Jackie Chan Movies Made An Absolutely Insane Amount Of Money ">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./is-dr-dre-s-net-worth-overhyped-or-undervalued.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Is Dr. Dre's Net Worth Overhyped Or Undervalued?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
