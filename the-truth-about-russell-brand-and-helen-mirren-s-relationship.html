The two famous Brits struck up an immediate bond because they both grew up in Essex. “We have a peculiar kind of relationship, but the part of the world we come from is in our DNA. He’s an Essex boy, I’m an Essex girl and we relish that.”</p><p>“It’s a funny friendship.<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> It’s not a friendship where we go out to dinner together</a> or I go round to his house. But whenever we’re together, it’s as if we’d met at another time, in another universe,” Helen Mirren added</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Helen-Mirren-and-Vin-Diesel-in-F9-via-The-New-York-Times.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Helen Mirren And Vin Diesel Have A Surprisingly Close Relationship</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Helen Mirren and Vin Diesel are closer than most co-stars, surprisingly enough.</span><p>Russell Brand has praised the actress, who won an Academy Award for playing Queen Elizabeth II.

Speaking ahead of the Sydney premiere of Arthur, he admitted: "She's a Dame, a lady."</p><p>"<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">I was naturally quite respectful.</a> I was shy when I met her," the Get Him To The Greek star explained, "I really love her and respect her tremendously."</p><h2 id=was-there-ever-a-romantic-connection-between-helen-mirren-and-russell-brand>Was There Ever A Romantic Connection Between Helen Mirren And Russell Brand?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/helen-mirren-russlel-brand.jpg><p>Although the pair love to flirt together, their relationship has never been more than just friends. In a 2011 interview with Stylist, Helen Mirren was asked if the comedian ever "tried it on with her."</p><p>"I was hoping that he would," the Oscar-winning actress replied, "but he never did. We did get into bed with each other, didn't we? I mean, we did a scene in bed." <a href=#>Russell Brand was married to Katy Perry</a> when the pair filmed Arthur together.

"I defy male, female or age-appropriate child to spend two hours with Russell and not be completely charmed," she said. Brand has been married to blogger and former restauranteur Laura Gallacher since 2018.</p><p>The admiration is clearly mutual between the pair: "We had a wonderful relationship, is the truth of it," Brand explained.

The Calendar Girls revealed that she has a pair of<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Russell Brand's underpants</a>. She revealed Brand gave them to her when they finished filming Arthur together. Mirren said, "I am the proud owner of a pair of Russell's yellow underpants."</p><p>In the poorly-received movie, Brand donned nothing but black socks and colorful briefs for a wedding scene. He explained how they ended up with the acting dame, "On the last day of filming I was running late, so I just shoved on a yellow pair of American Apparel underpants. At the end of filming I rushed back to my dressing room and spotted a black pair and thought I'd change."</p><p>He reveals he left his dressing room and came face-to-face with the 1923 star. "That's when I heard my voice saying: 'Would you like these?'"</p><p>When asked why Mirren accepted his pants, he responds with, "Because she was being polite - because she's a Dame."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She also treasures a less personal gift from the star.

The pair bragged that Brand had sexual relations with the Sach's granddaughter. It caused a national scandal and almost ended the careers of Brand and Ross. Russell Brand penned an apology letter to the actor in 2014.</p><p>“[Brand's] brain is fast and brilliant and I hate it when they try to pull these people down. Being naughty – and it was schoolboy kind of behaviour – is one thing but there came a point where it was 'OK, can we please move on?" Helen defended him.</p><p>When asked about his critically panned role in Arthur, she continued to defend him. “He’s really smart, kind, hard working and he’s out there as well. I don’t know how he juggles being all those with being the Russell Brand we know and love. He’s a brilliant wordsmith. He uses language in an incredibly inventive way. He’s a truly extraordinary person.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiprqujmrmtecGrmKecXZ2yrbHNZqSiqqKau26%2BxKWYraGfo8Cptc9mq6utpJ18</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fthe-truth-about-russell-brand-and-helen-mirren-s-relationship.html&text=The%20Truth%20About%20Russell%20Brand%20And%20Helen%20Mirren%27s%20Relationship&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-truth-about-russell-brand-and-helen-mirren-s-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-truth-about-russell-brand-and-helen-mirren-s-relationship.html&title=The%20Truth%20About%20Russell%20Brand%20And%20Helen%20Mirren%27s%20Relationship" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fthe-truth-about-russell-brand-and-helen-mirren-s-relationship.html&title=The%20Truth%20About%20Russell%20Brand%20And%20Helen%20Mirren%27s%20Relationship" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fthe-truth-about-russell-brand-and-helen-mirren-s-relationship.html&title=The%20Truth%20About%20Russell%20Brand%20And%20Helen%20Mirren%27s%20Relationship" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-truth-about-russell-brand-and-helen-mirren-s-relationship.html&description=The%20Truth%20About%20Russell%20Brand%20And%20Helen%20Mirren%27s%20Relationship" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./what-danny-devito-actually-thought-of-it-s-always-sunny-in-philadelphia-s-grossest-episode.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What Danny DeVito Actually Thought Of It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia's Grossest Episode">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./t-wayne-under-investigation-following-rape-accusation.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="T-Wayne Under Investigation Following Rape Accusation">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
