Charles was born on October 13, 1953, only two years before Chris was born. Before his demise, he was known for liquor addiction which destroyed his marriage and brought about him functioning as a medical clinic groundskeeper.</p><p>As per reports, Charles struggled liquor addiction and dependence his whole life and died while living in a destitute safe house. Chris Rock was very close with his stepbrother and made an honest effort to save him from his negative behavior pattern. The entertainer supported him to go to recovery in 2005, however it was anything but a triumph as he left and never returned.</p><p>He got back to the safe house and continued to work at the medical clinic as a groundskeeper. On January 29, 2009, his wellbeing turned out to be more awful, and he was taken to Harlem, New York. He was unable to make it and died on February 4, 2006, at 52 years old, in the emergency clinic.</p><p>In spite of the fact that he may not be the Stone family’s most notable or persuasive part, he certainly outflanked his brothers regarding instructive foundation and had a MBA.</p><p>Andre Rock, Chris Rock’s quick more youthful kin, has kept a position of safety notwithstanding his brother’s popularity.</p><p>Andre, who was born in 1967, hasn’t been spotted around Chris or his family all the time.

He later moved to Brooklyn to investigate satire and be near his brothers subsequent to flopping secondary school.</p><p>The jokester joined the practice of his brothers in media outlets and is an entertainer and humorist.
