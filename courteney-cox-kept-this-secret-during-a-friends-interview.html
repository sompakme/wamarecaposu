Some even came away from the interview with fans scratching their heads at what they witnessed. One celebrity who proved to be able to outsmart Oprah was <strong><a href=#>Courteney Cox</a></strong>.

When that did not happen right away after the show concluded, tabloids followed her every move and critiqued her appearance consistently.</p><p>As such, the media was on baby watch when it came to Aniston, making life uncomfortable for both herself and her then-husband. This is because rumors swirled that there were problems with conceiving when in reality this was not the case.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/oprah-winfrey-smiling.jpg><p>"Everybody's saying you're having baby struggles," Oprah said.</p><p>Aniston replied, "I'm not having any baby struggles."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Does it aggravate you, really, because I knew that would happen," Oprah stated.

What's the most amazing thing that's been written about you."</p><p>"Probably the pictures of me and one of my good friends who's gay and how I'm having an affair with him while my husband's going to the market," Kudrow answered.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/oprah-winfrey-at-the-los-angeles-premiere-of-apple-tv-s-sidney.jpg><p>Perry jumped in and said, "There was a story in one of the tabloids that I was dating a major celebrity that I've never met before on page four, and on page five, right there, was a huge story about how gay I was. ...
