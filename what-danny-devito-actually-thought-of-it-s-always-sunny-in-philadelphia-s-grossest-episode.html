Despite the fact that <a href=#>DeVito caused stress during the production of the second season</a> of It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia, he's been an undeniable asset to the hit sitcom.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This is something the writers were reminded of while filming one of the most beloved and downright grossest episodes of the FXX series. Many A-list stars like Danny DeVito would stay fifty feet away from the contents of Season Four episode 7's "Who Pooped the Bed?". But this wasn't the case with the Batman Returns star. During <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an oral history of "Who Pooped the Bed?" by Cracked,</a> the writers of the episode revealed what Danny DeVito really thought of all the depravity.</p><h2 id=is-quot-who-pooped-the-bed-quot-the-funniest-episode-of-it-39-s-always-sunny-in-philadephia>Is "Who Pooped The Bed" The Funniest Episode Of It's Always Sunny In Philadephia?</h2><p>What's the funniest episode of It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia? Well, that's entirely subjective, now isn't it? But there's no doubt that Season Four's "Who Pooped the Bed" <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">is on almost every single list</a>. Likely because it's one of the best, and downright insane, uses of Danny DeVito's Frank in the entire series so far.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The entire concept of the episode is ridiculous in the best possible way. While sleeping on a fold-out couch, Frank and Charlie Day's Charlie discover a big turd. What follows is a mystery that Rob McElehenney's Mac and Glenn Howerton's Dennis have to solve. While both Frank and Charlie appear guilty, it's ultimately Danny DeVito's character who admits to being the pooper.</p><p>It's cringey. It's gross. And it's downright funny.</p><h2 id=the-origin-of-quot-who-pooped-the-bed-quot>The Origin Of "Who Pooped The Bed?"</h2><p>During an interview with Cracked, Scott Marder the co-writer of "Who Pooped the Bed" claimed that the idea actually came from Charlie Day.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Charlie came in really giddy, saying, 'What if Frank and Charlie came in fighting about a turd they found between them?'" Marder said to Cracked.</p><p>"The idea was a whodunit, and it came together pretty easily," co-writer Rob Rosell added. "Our favorite scene was the one where the kid in the lab was breaking down what would be in the poop. We ended up with wolf hair, newspapers, pieces of credit card and lots of blood. I’m sure there were hundreds of things that were in that poop at one point or another."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>These 'It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia' Episodes Almost Got The Show Canceled</a></span></p><p>Marder went on to say that the location of the episode was a great inspiration.</p><p>"Anybody from the show would tell you that Charlie’s apartment is this magical comedy place. It’s so teeny and crazy, and you could put anything in there. It has really funny vibes, so getting to spend that scene there where Mac and Dennis observe Frank and Charlie sleep, and then they just all end up in the bed sleeping together, was a lot of fun for everybody."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The writers experimented with multiple outcomes for the episode. But ultimately, they came to the conclusion that it would be funniest if Danny DeVito's Frank was the guilty party.</p><p>"This was such a flag-planting episode for [Frank] where it really established that he was more deranged than all the rest of them," Marder admitted.</p><h2 id=what-danny-devito-thought-of-quot-who-pooped-the-bed-quot>What Danny DeVito Thought Of "Who Pooped The Bed?"</h2><p>While most A-list celebrities simply wouldn't want their image associated with such a depraved and seemingly 'low-brow' storyline, Danny DeVito was reportedly all for it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Danny couldn’t be more down to try stuff," episode co-writer Rob Rosell said to Cracked. "He has no ego, he just wants to make something funny and he never lets his celebrity or accomplishments stand in the way of doing something humiliating, like crawling out of a couch naked."</p><p>This, of course, is referring to the Season Six Christmas special where Frank, covered in nothing but jelly, bursts out of the couch.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Charlie Day's Relationship With Mary Elizabeth Ellis Is As Strange As Something From Its Always Sunny In Philadelphia</a></span></p><p>"The couch idea came from [Rob] McElhenney," co-writer Scott Marder explained to Cracked. "He’d seen an article about how some Mexicans were getting sewn into car seats to get across the border, and he said, 'We’ve got to figure out how to do that.' Eventually, it evolved into getting DeVito into a couch, covered in jelly. I remember, after they shot it, Kaitlin came upstairs and said, 'I just looked directly down the eye of DeVito’s b*tth*le.'"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Marder went on to say that he and the rest of the It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia team are always impressed by Denny DeVito's willingness to participate in some truly debaucherous scenes for the sake of a laugh.</p><p>"He’s this big Hollywood celebrity, but nothing makes him blush," Marder added.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>10 Behind The Scenes Facts About Danny DeVito's Role On 'It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia'</a></span></p><p>"[Danny DeVito] just wants it to be funny," Rossell said in the excellent interview with Cracked. 'DeVito is one of the most amazing performers of all time. In anything he does, no matter how despicable, depraved or bizarre, there’s an element of sweetness and innocence to it because of Danny. You can’t not like Danny DeVito."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibmqaernqlsdWiq6hllqeur7eMoqusZZGhxKLF0maqrqaernqquoypn6KkkZmyrbzHophmr5ikerG7zqmcnWWknbJursSdZJ6omai8pbGO</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-danny-devito-actually-thought-of-it-s-always-sunny-in-philadelphia-s-grossest-episode.html&text=What%20Danny%20DeVito%20Actually%20Thought%20Of%20It%27s%20Always%20Sunny%20In%20Philadelphia%27s%20Grossest%20Episode&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-danny-devito-actually-thought-of-it-s-always-sunny-in-philadelphia-s-grossest-episode.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-danny-devito-actually-thought-of-it-s-always-sunny-in-philadelphia-s-grossest-episode.html&title=What%20Danny%20DeVito%20Actually%20Thought%20Of%20It%27s%20Always%20Sunny%20In%20Philadelphia%27s%20Grossest%20Episode" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-danny-devito-actually-thought-of-it-s-always-sunny-in-philadelphia-s-grossest-episode.html&title=What%20Danny%20DeVito%20Actually%20Thought%20Of%20It%27s%20Always%20Sunny%20In%20Philadelphia%27s%20Grossest%20Episode" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-danny-devito-actually-thought-of-it-s-always-sunny-in-philadelphia-s-grossest-episode.html&title=What%20Danny%20DeVito%20Actually%20Thought%20Of%20It%27s%20Always%20Sunny%20In%20Philadelphia%27s%20Grossest%20Episode" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-danny-devito-actually-thought-of-it-s-always-sunny-in-philadelphia-s-grossest-episode.html&description=What%20Danny%20DeVito%20Actually%20Thought%20Of%20It%27s%20Always%20Sunny%20In%20Philadelphia%27s%20Grossest%20Episode" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./youtuber-peter-monn-injured-after-a-fatal-accident-here-is-how-he-is-doing-after-the-unfortunate-ev.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Youtuber Peter Monn Injured After A Fatal Accident, Here Is How He Is Doing After The Unfortunate Ev">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./the-truth-about-russell-brand-and-helen-mirren-s-relationship.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Truth About Russell Brand And Helen Mirren's Relationship">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
