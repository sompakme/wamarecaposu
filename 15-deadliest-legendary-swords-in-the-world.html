Other blades have been crafted by master swordsmiths, who fold metal with such precision and skill that the sword endures stress that would easily shatter lesser weapons. Of course, no list of legendary swords would be incomplete without mysterious powers, like the hidden ability to control wind and fire.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Part of the reason these swords retain their mythical status is due to the fact that many of them have been used in battle by famous figures&nbsp;before being passed down through history. Occasionally, these swords disappear for centuries before resurfacing. A few of them are rumored to be stolen or existing out of sight, protected by priests and other spiritual folk who consider them to be items of mystical importance.</p><p>Thankfully, many are still available to be witnessed&nbsp;by the general public, kept safe from thieves behind climate-controlled Plexiglas that also protects against the ravages of time, so their legend can continue to be passed down&nbsp;from generation to generation.</p><h2 id=szczerbiec>15.

Even though the sword was said to be completed during the 12th century at the earliest, there's a possibility that it was used to strike a gate during a siege at some point in history, which was a symbolic action performed by militaries at the time.</p><p>Szczerbiec was used as a coronation sword for hundreds of years before it was looted. Eventually, it returned to Poland, where it's kept as the only surviving crown jewel of that era.</p><p></p><h2 id=zulfiqar>14.

However, unlike scimitars, after the bend the Zulfiqar turns into a double-bladed terror with a slight scissored opening that resembles a snake tongue.</p><p>Nicknamed by some as 'The Spine-Splitter", the Zulfiqar was apparently gifted to Ali because of his ability to destroy the armor of the mightiest combatants from the Mecca region. Impressed, Muhammad replaced the warrior's broken sword.According to rumor and legend, the Zulfiqar currently belongs to the hidden Imam, Muhammad al-Mahdi, who is seen as the eventual savior of humankind and the final Imam, bringing peace to Earth and justice to all.</p><p></p><h2 id=tomoyuki-yamashita-s-sword>13.

A General within the Japanese armed forces, Tomoyuki, called "The Tiger of Malaysia", made sure that this deadly, centuries-old relic was at his side throughout combat operations during WWII.</p><p>After the Allies finally forced Japan to surrender, General Yamashita gave up the sword along with his army. Incredibly, the blade was still in excellent condition - only the hilt needed to be fixed, which took place during the early 20th century.&nbsp;This legendary blade currently resides in the West Point Military Museum.</p><p></p><h2 id=sword-of-osman>12.

The Sword of Osman was named after the creator of the Ottomans after his father-in-law, Sheik Edebali, passed along the weapon as a sword of Islam.</p><p>Sultans who succeeded Osman I followed this tradition, allowing the Sword of Osman to fall into the hands of some of the most powerful individuals the world has ever known, including Suleiman the Great.&nbsp;It took almost 500 years for the Ottomans to allow non-Muslims the privilege of witnessing the ceremony that passed the sword from one leader to the next.</p><p></p><h2 id=jewelled-sword-of-offering>11.

King George IV was directly involved with the design of this sword and paid for it through&nbsp;the King's privy purse.</p><p>This sword of offering is passed down after each coronation and becomes property of the new person in power. After receiving a blessing from an Archbishop, the spiritually imbued sword is passed to the new monarch, who is charged with using the blade for the purposes of defending good and destroying evil.</p><p></p><h2 id=10-seven-branched-sword>10.&nbsp;Seven-Branched Sword</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Seven-Branched-Sword.jpg> ancient-origins.net <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After archaeologists and historians studied the remarkable seven-branched sword, they found that the origins of the sword potentially date all the way back to the Jin Dynasty of the fourth century. This likely represented the peak of sword-smithing at the time, with the seven branches expressing a tree motif.</p><p>Various interpretations have been made of the text inscribed into this ancient, historical blade. The text suggests that&nbsp;the sword is&nbsp;made of steel hardened 100 times, resulting in an unprecedented weapon. Originally, it appears the sword was made for the King of Wa, but was eventually passed along as a gift to&nbsp;a Japanese empress, eventually ending up in the Isonokami Shrine where it's hidden from view.</p><p></p><h2 id=la-tizona>9.

The blade followed one of the biggest heroes in Spanish history throughout his conquests on behalf of both Christian and Islamic armies.&nbsp;Controversy surrounds La Tizona as to whether or not it was one of two legendary swords wielded by El Cid. La Tizona was said to have been passed down over the years to King Ferdinand and family, until donated to the Madrid Military Museum.</p><p>A variety of tests performed on the sword confirmed the presence of Damascus steel, which is a fortified material that made many of the best swords for royalty, aristocrats and high-ranking military leaders.</p><p></p><h2 id=curtana---sword-of-mercy>8.

Legend has it that one of the most storied knights, Tristan, who in lore broke the end of the sword off in the brain cavity of an evil Medieval man named Morholt.</p><p>The sword was rumored to have been adopted by Ogier the Dane, who shorted the sword and rechristen it Cortaine.&nbsp;After a healthy killing career, the sword ended up altered at the end to blunt its sharpness, earning another name: the Sword of Mercy. This version of Curtana makes appearances at various royal events of importance as a ceremonial item.</p><p></p><h2 id=curved-saber-of-san-martin>7.

This fabled weapon is rumored to have been forged using the same steel as Curtana and Durendal, including a pommel made with the remains of the Lance of Longinus.</p><p>This process resulted in a sword fit for Charlemagne, who wielded Joyeuse as he sliced through Europe as commander and eventual emperor of the Holy Roman Empire.&nbsp;Joyeuse has been handed down through history, with experts suggesting that a replica replaced the original during the coronation of Napoleon. Currently, Joyeuse consists of a variety of parts added to a Medieval blade that dates back to the 10th century, complicating the legacy of Joyeuse.</p><p></p><h2 id=muramasa>5.

Unfortunately, Mr. Sengo was also known to be as mad as he was brilliant. His brain was considered so unstable and violent that his swords contained a dark aura which caused the wielder to crave murder and suicide.</p><p>His swords were popular for quite a while but eventually fell out of favor when shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu forbade his samurai for using this type of sword, possibly because so many people he knew were killed by them with the shogun himself receiving a nasty wound from a muramasa sword in battle.</p><p></p><h2 id=honjo-masamune>4.

Thankfully, he tempered his sword making prowess with wisdom instead of imbuing psychotic energy into his edged creations.</p><p>Of all the famed Masamune swords, the Honjo Masamune is perhaps the most legendary. The blade earned its status as the greatest sword ever fashioned by splitting the helm of Honjo Shigenaga, who captured the sword after nearly being killed by its brilliant sharpness.&nbsp;Despite nicks and cracks, it was still effective in battle. This legendary sword disappeared around 1946, when the Honjo Masamune was dropped off at a police station, never to be seen again.</p><p></p><h2 id=kusanagi>3.

The latest location of Kusanagi is rumored to be well-protected by Shinto priests, hidden away from prying eyes.</p><p>In the ancient tome Kojiki, the origins of the sword was similar to a boss battle in Dark Souls, as a hero named Susanoo found the sword in the fourth tail of an eight headed serpent that the god was in the midst of defeating.&nbsp;The sword was eventually passed on to fabled warrior Yamato Takeru, who used the power of the sword to redirect a fire trap towards a warlord who attempted to burn Yamato alive.</p><p></p><h2 id=sword-of-goujian>2.

Incredibly, this bronze sword was still sharp enough to use when it was found.&nbsp;This legendary sword survived because of the high levels of copper in the blade.

Apparently, the repairs were needed to the hilt, which apparently was made with the dried skin of an English commander he defeated.&nbsp;The Wallace Sword now rests in the Wallace Monument as one of the most prized artifacts from Scottish history.</p><p>Sources: <a href=#>ListVerse</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>Swide</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>Royal Collection</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqttdKtZmptXZmyorDLopysrF2hsqixzZ2Yq7FdqMSwvsOsZKKmXam1pnnWqKmlnF8%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f15-deadliest-legendary-swords-in-the-world.html&text=15%20Deadliest%20Legendary%20Swords%20In%20The%20World&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f15-deadliest-legendary-swords-in-the-world.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f15-deadliest-legendary-swords-in-the-world.html&title=15%20Deadliest%20Legendary%20Swords%20In%20The%20World" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f15-deadliest-legendary-swords-in-the-world.html&title=15%20Deadliest%20Legendary%20Swords%20In%20The%20World" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f15-deadliest-legendary-swords-in-the-world.html&title=15%20Deadliest%20Legendary%20Swords%20In%20The%20World" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f15-deadliest-legendary-swords-in-the-world.html&description=15%20Deadliest%20Legendary%20Swords%20In%20The%20World" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./alan-price-net-worth-age-height-weight-family-wiki-2024.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Alan Price Net Worth, Age, Height, Weight, Family, Wiki 2024">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./what-happened-to-scott-cawthon-canceled-or-retired-is-he-still-alive-or-dead.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What Happened To Scott Cawthon?
