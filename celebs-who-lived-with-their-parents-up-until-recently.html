Despite being amongst the richest and most famous people in the world, they still went back home to live with their parents! Well, they aren't the only celebs who have done so.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Does Olivia Rodrigo Still Live With Her Parents?</a></span></p><p>Pete Davidson notoriously <a href=#>lived in his mother's basement</a> for years before getting a place of his own, and we don't blame him for doing it one bit! So, which other <a href=#>celebs lived with their parents</a> despite being rich and famous? Let's dive in!</p><h2 id=pete-davidson><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Pete Davidson</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Pete Davidson has been living large ever since he gained prominence in the comedy scene. Following his success on Saturday Night Live, Davidson was all anyone could talk about – that and his split from pop icon, Ariana Grande, of course. Well, it seems as if Pete made headlines when he revealed that he still lived with his mother in Staten Island, despite being worth millions.</p><p>Turns out, the duo bought a house together in their New York neighborhood, where <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pete occupied the entire basement.</a> Although their setup was stellar, and Pete's relationship with his mom is nothing short of amazing, the actor and comedian ultimately pulled the plug and officially get a place of his own following the release of his 2020 film, The King Of Staten Island.</p><h2 id=jennifer-lawrence><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Jennifer Lawrence</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jennifer Lawrence is without a doubt one of the biggest names in Hollywood, so what was she doing living with her parents for so long? During her interview on The Ellen Show, Jennifer, who was an Oscar winner at the time, mentioned that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she still lived with her mom.</a></p><p>The Hunger Games star went on to reveal that during her time living at home, her Oscar voting ballot, which all Academy members receive, ended up in her mom's hands, leading her to cast the vote instead! Luckily for Lawrence, she doesn't have to worry about that anymore after having moved out on her own.</p><h2 id=zendaya><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Zendaya</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Zendaya is on the rise and we love to see it! The Emmy winner has been crushing the game when it comes to her performance in Euphoria, which has easily made her millions. While she's on her own now, Zendaya recently lived with her parents, however, she didn't mind it in the slightest.</p><p>Despite her fame and fortune, the actress shared with Ellen DeGeneres that having mom and dad under the same roof has its perks, which include mom being a human alarm clock, and of course, having meals ready at any given moment. The star also discussed the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">boundaries that they had in place</a>, which made for a much easier living situation.</p><h2 id=addison-rae><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Addison Rae</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Addison Rae has been on the rise ever since her success on TikTok. The star released her very first video back in July of 2019 and is now one of the biggest names from the app. During her visit to the Unfiltered podcast, Addison revealed that despite her online fame, she remained at home in Louisana where her parents continued to support her dreams of becoming an entertainer.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Addison Rae Opens Up About Moving To Los Angeles</a></span></p><p>Well, it didn't take much time before <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she left college and Louisiana</a> for Los Angeles, which is where she currently resides.

Despite being one of the biggest names in music, Eilish still lives with her parents, which is understandable considering she is only 19 years old.</p><p>Well, turns out that she not only lives with her parents but <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sometimes sleeps in their bed!</a> Billie shared that she suffers from certain sleep disorders that impact her sleep schedule, so sleeping alongside mom and dad provides her with the security and protection needed to get a good night's rest.</p><h2 id=michael-b-jordan><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Michael B. Jordan</span></h2><p>Michael B. Jordan may have made a name for himself in Creed and as a member of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, however, that doesn't mean he's about that solo living life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2016, Jordan <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">purchased a home for him and his parents</a> in Oakbank, California, and while he got a lot of questions regarding his living situation, he made it clear that it was his dream to be able to do this for his mom and dad. While they lived together for a few years, the actor is no longer roommates with his parents, especially now that he is in a serious relationship with Lori Harvey.</p><h2 id=peter-weber><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Peter Weber</span></h2><p>Although Peter might be one of the most popular names to come out of Bachelor Nation, that doesn't mean he's not a momma's boy! The former Bachelor revealed that he lived with his parents up until his newfound fame, and a little after, too!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>10 Lesser-Known Facts About 'Bachelor' Star, Peter Weber</a></span></p><p>Considering his job, which is being a pilot, requires him to be gone a lot, there was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">no purpose for him to have a place of his own</a> – that is, until he found "the one".</p><h2 id=amanda-bynes><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Amanda Bynes</span></h2><p>Amanda Bynes was the "it" actor of the 2000s, however, things took a turn following a slew of mental health issues stemming from her rough upbringing in the spotlight. Bynes remains under a conservatorship, which is controlled by her parents, whom she lived with for years after her downward spiral.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While this situation is not one that Amanda loves, so much that she has called out for help on social media, it appears as if things are much better. Bynes, whose conservatorship <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">has been extended to 2023</a>, has slightly more autonomy now, so much that she even got engaged!</p><h2 id=spencer-and-heidi><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Spencer And Heidi</span></h2><p>Heidi Montag and Spencer Pratt were on top of the world following their success on MTV's hit series, The Hills. Despite making millions, and having a collective net worth of $10 million to be exact, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the duo blew through all of their money</a>, and as of 2012, they were broke.</p><p>Speidi then moved into Spencer's parent's home, as they couldn't afford to live the lavish lifestyle they once did. Luckily for the two, The Hills: New Beginnings came about, allowing Speidi to earn money consistently, which has allowed them to move out and live in their own condo within the Hollywood Hills.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Check Out The Strange Decor Inside These Celebrities Home</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGianqSVl8Buw8eoZKWhppqxbsPIrZ9mrJiatrN5z5qpnqakqHq2vIyupa2hnGK%2Fpq%2FEp6ulsV2vsq%2BwwLKYZqiVqbJusMCvoJ2rn6N6ornAp5uaZZKuu6a%2Fjg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fcelebs-who-lived-with-their-parents-up-until-recently.html&text=Celebs%20Who%20Lived%20With%20Their%20Parents%20Up%20Until%20Recently&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcelebs-who-lived-with-their-parents-up-until-recently.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcelebs-who-lived-with-their-parents-up-until-recently.html&title=Celebs%20Who%20Lived%20With%20Their%20Parents%20Up%20Until%20Recently" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fcelebs-who-lived-with-their-parents-up-until-recently.html&title=Celebs%20Who%20Lived%20With%20Their%20Parents%20Up%20Until%20Recently" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fcelebs-who-lived-with-their-parents-up-until-recently.html&title=Celebs%20Who%20Lived%20With%20Their%20Parents%20Up%20Until%20Recently" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcelebs-who-lived-with-their-parents-up-until-recently.html&description=Celebs%20Who%20Lived%20With%20Their%20Parents%20Up%20Until%20Recently" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./chad-michael-murray-and-alexis-bledel-played-gilmore-girls-love-interests-but-did-the-actors-actual.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Chad Michael Murray And Alexis Bledel Played Gilmore Girls Love Interests, But Did The Actors Actual">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./carl-tamayo-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Carl Tamayo Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
