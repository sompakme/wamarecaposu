Jackson has been in the game for quite some time and has starred in several blockbusters.</span><h2 id=early-life-and-entry-into-hollywood>Early Life And Entry Into Hollywood</h2><p>Samuel Leroy Jackson was born in 1948 and raised in Washington, DC. As a child, he struggled with stuttering and dyslexia (and would occasionally use swear words to get through his speech block), but would later find solace in acting.</p><p>His activism started in his youth as he attended several segregated schools, and he was present at Martin Luther King Jr.'s funeral as an usher. Jackson studied drama at Morehouse College, where he joined an acting group; however, after taking a public speaking class and featuring in a version of The Threepenny Opera, he switched his major to drama and graduated in 1972.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jackson began his acting career on the stage, appearing in several stage productions, like A Soldier's Play. He also performed in Off-Broadway productions of Mother Courage And Her Children.</p><p>Jackson made his feature film debut in Michael Schultz-directed independent film Together For Days in 1972. After playing other minor roles, he moved from Atlanta to New York in 1976.</p><p>In the Big Apple, he appeared in stage productions like The Piano Lesson and Two Trains. Between 1976 and 1991, he was cast in several television shows such as Movin' On, The Displaced Person, and Dead Man Out.</p><p>Jackson worked as a night guard at New York's Manhattan Plaza complex to supplement his income while continuing to audition for roles, as he struggled to find consistent work</p><h2 id=rise-to-international-fame>Rise To International Fame</h2><p>Samuel L. Jackson's breakthrough came in 1991 with his role as Gator in <a href=#>Spike Lee</a>'s Jungle Fever – after Lee had cast him in minor roles in Ragtime, School Daze, and Do the Right Thing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>His performance in Gator garnered him praise among critics, and these roles showcased his ability to tackle complex characters with depth and authenticity.

Jackson's career took a significant turn when he landed the role of Jules Winnfield in <a href=#>Quentin Tarantino</a>'s modern-day masterpiece Pulp Fiction. The role propelled him into cinematic stratosphere, and earned him widespread acclaim and critical recognition.</p><p>His portrayal of the charismatic hitman won him the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role and also earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor, solidifying his status as a Hollywood superstar. In addition to his work on the big screen, Jackson has also appeared on television.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Pulp Fiction grossed $213 million at the box office on the back of an $8.5 million production budget.</p><p>Following the success of Pulp Fiction, Jackson went on to appear in several other high-profile films, including Die Hard with a Vengeance (1995), A Time to Kill (1996), The Long Kiss Goodnight (1996), and Jackie Brown (1997), for which he received a Golden Globe nomination.</p><p>He had a recurring role on the hit series Touched by an Angel from 1995 to 1997, and lent his voice to several animated series. He played Jedi Master Mace Windu in Star Wars: Phantom Menace and reprised his role in other entries of the franchise.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2000, Jackson landed a leading role in the remake of Shaft, and also appeared alongside <a href=#>Bruce Willis</a> in Unbreakable.
