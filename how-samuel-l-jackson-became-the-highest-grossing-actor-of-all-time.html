After playing other minor roles, he moved from Atlanta to New York in 1976.</p><p>In the Big Apple, he appeared in stage productions like The Piano Lesson and Two Trains. Between 1976 and 1991, he was cast in several television shows such as Movin' On, The Displaced Person, and Dead Man Out.</p><p>Jackson worked as a night guard at New York's Manhattan Plaza complex to supplement his income while continuing to audition for roles, as he struggled to find consistent work</p><h2 id=rise-to-international-fame>Rise To International Fame</h2><p>Samuel L.
