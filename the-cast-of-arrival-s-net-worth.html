With 8 Oscar nominations (and 1 win), this drama mystery follows a linguist who is hired by the military to communicate with an alien species - who have mysteriously landed 12 spacecrafts around the world.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Most Expensive Sci-Fi Movies Ever Made</a></span></p><p>Despite the utter brilliance of this stunning film, it also has an impeccable and pretty A-list cast. In case you're wondering which one of these actors could probably afford their own spaceship, we've made a list. Here is the cast of this incredible sci-fi flick and their net worth (according to <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a>).</p><h2 id=christian-jadah---500-000>Christian Jadah - $500,000</h2><p>Christian Jadah's net worth isn't super flashy, but this upcoming actor is certainly going to be coming onto our radar soon. He actually already has a few dozen acting credits, but most of them are small television roles or supporting movie characters.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Still, you might remember him as Private Combs in&nbsp;Arrival,&nbsp;but he also had small roles in&nbsp;X-Men: Days of Future Past, Quantico, The Hummingbird Project,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Separated at Birth. Clearly, he's been in television and film, and this man is a pretty regular background actor. Of course, we expect to see him on the front lines soon.</p><h2 id=mark-o-brien---1-million>Mark O'Brien - $1 Million</h2><p>This young actor is currently breaking open the doors to Hollywood. While he was Captain Marks in this sci-fi flick, he's actually been a part of some huge projects since then. You might recognize this face from some recent blockbuster films, including&nbsp;The Darkest Minds, Bad Times at the El Royale, Ready or Not,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Marriage Story.&nbsp;</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>DCEU: Net Worth Of The Justice League</a></span></p><p>He also has a couple more movies in the works, so we expect that his breakout is yet to come. Still, at this point in his career, $1 million is nothing to sneer at, and we're sure his net worth is only about to climb.</p><h2 id=frank-schorpion---2-million>Frank Schorpion - $2 Million</h2><p>This man was Dr. Kettler in this alien movie, but he has over 100 acting credits to show for his career. Of course, most of these are also one-time television show appearances or small movie roles. Still, you might recognize him most recently from&nbsp;The Hummingbird Project (alongside our friend, Christian!), Pet Sematary,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Good Sam.&nbsp;</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This man is no newbie, and this net worth shows for about three decades of small acting roles. He even has three in the works, so we're sure we'll see more of this man before he's done in Hollywood.</p><h2 id=michael-stuhlbarg---3-million>Michael Stuhlbarg - $3 Million</h2><p>Michael Stuhlbarg played Agent Halpern in&nbsp;Arrival,&nbsp;but it turns out that he's actually been in quite a few Oscar-nominated flicks. Again, mainly secondary roles, but you've definitely seen his face in the&nbsp;The Shape of Water, The Post,&nbsp;and Call Me by Your Name. In fact, he was even in&nbsp;Doctor Strange!&nbsp;</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Amy Adams: 10 Best Movies (According To IMDb)</a></span></p><p>However, most of this net worth probably comes from his television acting, where he had a recurring role in&nbsp;Boardwalk Empire, Fargo, The Looming Tower,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Traitors.&nbsp;He's actually been a part of some seriously famous projects, and we're sure that net worth is far from its peak.</p><h2 id=forest-whitaker---40-million>Forest Whitaker - $40 Million</h2><p>Forest Whitaker is quite a legend in the industry, and he played Colonel Weber in this sci-fi drama. While he has over 100 acting credits under his belt, it's not surprising his net worth is as high at is. If you're wondering what his most recent projects are, you'll probably recognize this famous face from&nbsp;Black Panther, City of Lies,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Rogue One: A Star Wars Story.&nbsp;</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Surprisingly, this actor actually has a lot of television experience, too, and most recently had a recurring role in&nbsp;Empire&nbsp;and&nbsp;Godfather of Harlem.&nbsp;He's not done acting yet, and we expect much more from this talented man.</p><h2 id=jeremy-renner---50-million>Jeremy Renner - $50 Million</h2><p>Jeremy Renner co-starred with Amy Adams in this flick as Ian Donnelly. Of course, we probably know this man best as Clint Barton (AKA Hawkeye) from the Avengers franchise. Obviously, that's likely where most of this man's dough comes from. Still, Jeremy Renner certainly doesn't get enough credit for his versaility, and we suggest checking out American Hustle&nbsp;and&nbsp;Wind River&nbsp;for some brilliant films.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Avengers Franchise: Every Cast Member's Net Worth</a></span></p><p>Of course, he's also pretty prominent in action flicks (including Mission Impossible&nbsp;and the&nbsp;Bourne&nbsp;franchise), and you'll definitely see him in the new Hawkeye television series from Disney+. We love this man, and this movie was certainly better with him in it!</p><h2 id=amy-adams---60-million>Amy Adams - $60 Million</h2><p>Amy Adams was perfect for the role of Louise Banks, but she continues to blow us away time and time again. She's actually been nominated for 6 Oscars, so, it's not surprising her net worth is as impressive as it is. She was actually also in&nbsp;American Hustle&nbsp;alongside Jeremy Renner, and more critically-acclaimed films&nbsp;include&nbsp;Nocturnal Animals, Her,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Vice.&nbsp;</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In fact, she's also dabbled in the superhero world, but joined DC's side as Lois Lane, Superman's leading lady. You can also catch this bombshell on television, where she played the lead role in Sharp Objects.&nbsp;Amy Adams is a versatile and brilliant actress, and we certainly can't see what's yet to come from this incredible woman.</p><h2 id=tzi-ma---65-million>Tzi Ma - $65 Million</h2><p>If you didn't know this man's name, you've certainly seen his face. He plays General Shang in this sci-fi flick, but he has over 100 acting credits that have helped create his impressive net worth. He's certainly a legendary actor, and most recently you'd probably recognize him from&nbsp;Skyscraper, Bad Company,&nbsp;and&nbsp;The Farewell.&nbsp;</p><p>However, he's actually a pretty regular television actor, including many one-time roles, but also recurring ones in&nbsp;The Man in the High Castle, Silicon Valley&nbsp;and&nbsp;Wu Assassins.&nbsp;In fact, you can catch this talented man in the upcoming live-action&nbsp;Mulan.&nbsp;That net worth will only be growing, and of that we're pretty confident!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>Every Cast Member Of The New Star Wars Trilogy Net Worth</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpqemnrK0e8CrqaKukaF6pK3SrWSnnaRixLC%2B06Fm</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fthe-cast-of-arrival-s-net-worth.html&text=The%20Cast%20Of%20Arrival%27s%20Net%20Worth&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-cast-of-arrival-s-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-cast-of-arrival-s-net-worth.html&title=The%20Cast%20Of%20Arrival%27s%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fthe-cast-of-arrival-s-net-worth.html&title=The%20Cast%20Of%20Arrival%27s%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fthe-cast-of-arrival-s-net-worth.html&title=The%20Cast%20Of%20Arrival%27s%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-cast-of-arrival-s-net-worth.html&description=The%20Cast%20Of%20Arrival%27s%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./10-rappers-who-have-lied-about-their-fortunes.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="10 Rappers Who Have Lied About Their Fortunes">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./sophie-simmons-net-worth-therichest.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Sophie Simmons Net Worth | TheRichest">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
