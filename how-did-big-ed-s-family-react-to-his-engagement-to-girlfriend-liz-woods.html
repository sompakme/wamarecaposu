After <a href=#>Big Ed and Rose broke up</a>, he fell in love with Liz nine months after, but then the two separated ways six months into their relationship. Ed being single again, joined 90-day fiancé: The Single Life but got ghosted by her Mexican ex-partner, Kaory.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Following his struggle to find love, his dog Teddy loses his life which puts the 56-year-old in an emotional state. But Liz enters the picture again and sends him a letter saying her care and condolences. The couple got back together in September 2021, engaged in November of that year, and plan to get married in August 2022.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Truth About '90 Day Fiancé' Big Ed's Rumored Engagement</a></span></p><p>However, fans have been skeptical about the real between them despite their ongoing relationship as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">screenshots of Liz's now-deleted Instagram post</a> saying, "I am belittled in creating a lifestyle that will never be me!!

However, Liz has a 7-year-old daughter, Ryleigh, with her ex-partner, while Big Ed also has Tiffany, her 31-year-old daughter.</p><p>Even before the couple gets married, Big Ed already welcomed Ryleigh as his child as part of their small family with Liz. There are few public interactions between Ryleigh and Big Ed, but it seems to be the opposite way between Liz and Tiffany.</p><h2 id=big-ed-39-s-daughter-is-uncomfortable-with-liz>Big Ed's Daughter Is Uncomfortable With Liz</h2><p>There are a few reasons why Big Ed's daughter Tiffany is uncomfortable with Liz, but the leading cause is their age difference. As Liz is only 30 years old and Tiffany is 31 years old, Tiffany tells his father it makes her uncomfortable that her soon-to-be stepmother is younger than her. Even before her father's engagement with Liz, she has already been vocal about what she feels towards Liz, but Big Ed still pushed through with the engagement nonetheless.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Aside from their age gap, Tiffany is also uncomfortable with Big Ed's 'playboy' lifestyle.
