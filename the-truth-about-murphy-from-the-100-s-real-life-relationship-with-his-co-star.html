As a result of all the viewers that couldn’t get enough of the series, The 100 remained on the air for seven seasons before it came to an end in 2020.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since The 100’s finale aired roughly a year and a half ago as of this writing, some people may have assumed that interest in the show would have died down by now. However, since fans of the series loved it so much, it makes sense that they continue to have a lot of passion for The 100 and the people who helped make it a reality. For example, fans want to know more about <a href=#>Shawn Mendes’ role in The 100</a>. On top of that, they are interested in <a href=#>what The 100 star Thomas McDonell has been up to since the series ended</a>. Most of all, The 100 fans want to know more about the fact that star Richard Harmon is dating another actor who appeared in their beloved show.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Are Eliza Taylor And Bob Morley Still Together? What We Know About Their Relationship</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=richard-rsquo-s-rise-to-stardom>Richard’s Rise To Stardom</h2><p>When Richard Harmon was still a baby, he made his television “acting” debut when he was hired to appear in an episode of the show Jeremiah. Of course, there is no way Harmon was the one who decided to take on that role, and to call anything a baby does acting is a massive stretch. All of that aside, once Harmon was old enough to be aware of the world, he continued to work consistently as a kid actor.</p><p>Unlike a lot of <a href=#>former child stars who have gotten in serious trouble</a>, Richard Harmon has managed to avoid becoming tabloid fodder. Instead, Harmon has enjoyed a great deal of success as an actor which may explain why he hasn’t gotten in too much trouble. After all, as the old adage goes, idle hands are The Devil’s playthings and Harmon is far too busy to stay still for too long.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>20 Former Disney Stars Who Got In Trouble With The Law</a></span></p><p>During the 2000s, Richard Harmon popped up in a seemingly endless array of shows and movies. However, it wasn’t until 2011 that Harmon’s career begin to take off once The Killing debuted on television. Hired for a recurring role that appeared in the first two seasons of The Killing, Richard Harmon managed to stand out enough in his role to land further opportunities.</p><p>From 2014 until 2020, The 100 fans tuned in to watch Richard Harmon bring John Murphy to life. Initially hired in a recurring role, after Harmon proved how talented he is as a performer, the powers that be behind The 100 promoted Harmon to the show’s main cast. As great as starring in The 100 was for his career, it turns out that Harmon’s role on the show did just as much to improve his personal life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Richard has been romantically linked to a couple of actors, namely UnReal star Genevieve Buechner (who also starred on The 100 as Fox) and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ciara Hanna from Power Rangers Megaforce</a>, his most significant relationship is with Rhiannon Fish.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>20 Super Strict Rules These Child Actors Had To Follow</a></span></p><h2 id=richard-is-dating-100-star-rhiannon-fish>Richard Is Dating 100 Star Rhiannon Fish</h2><p>After Rhiannon Fish launched her acting career in Australia, she rose to fame as a result of appearing in more than 300 episodes of the Australian soap opera Home and Away. Fish also notably appeared in 14 episodes of the Australian Disney Channel show As the Bell Rings and 20 episodes of the famous Australian soap opera Neighbours. On top of all that, Fish competed in the Australian version of Dancing with the Stars.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since Rhiannon Fish actually was born in Calgary, Alberta, Canada it makes sense that her life changed once she appeared in a show that was filmed in Vancouver. After all, in late-2015, Fish traveled to Vancouver to film The 100 and she ultimately appeared in seven episodes of the show that aired in 2016. While fans of The 100 took note of Fish’s obvious acting skills, Richard Harmon seemingly noticed how much he liked her as a person more than anything else.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In early-2019,<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> rumors that Richard Harmon and Rhiannon Fish were a couple began to surface</a>. Then in mid-2019, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fish posted an image of herself locking lips with Harmon on Instagram</a>, thus confirming that all of the conjecture about the couple’s relationship was well-founded. Funnily enough, Fish captioned the Instagram image “The most magical evening with this above average man” and Harmon responded to that by writing “ [That's the] nicest thing you've ever said about me”. Clearly, the couple has a playful relationship which always is nice to see.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since Rhiannon Fish and Richard Harmon went public with their relationship, they have been seen together on the red carpet. On top of that, each of them has posted still images online in which they look to be smitten with one another. If that wasn’t enough, videos of Harmon and Fish having fun together are regularly uploaded to their Instagram stories. Based on all of the available information, it seems like Fish and Harmon are overjoyed to be a huge part of each other’s lives. In fact, during one clip, Harmon can even be seen wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the words “Future Mrs. Fish” which is really easy to read into.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>10 Celebrity Couples Who Fell In Love On Set (& Are Still Together)</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGikrqqgncZuwMeeZGpoYGK%2Fqq%2FHmqmdZZiWv667zWajoJqkpnqotdGlnauhlaOxbr7Hopinpp%2Bjeqe10qFm</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fthe-truth-about-murphy-from-the-100-s-real-life-relationship-with-his-co-star.html&text=The%20Truth%20About%20Murphy%20From%20The%20100s%20Real-Life%20Relationship%20With%20His%20Co-Star&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-truth-about-murphy-from-the-100-s-real-life-relationship-with-his-co-star.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-truth-about-murphy-from-the-100-s-real-life-relationship-with-his-co-star.html&title=The%20Truth%20About%20Murphy%20From%20The%20100s%20Real-Life%20Relationship%20With%20His%20Co-Star" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fthe-truth-about-murphy-from-the-100-s-real-life-relationship-with-his-co-star.html&title=The%20Truth%20About%20Murphy%20From%20The%20100s%20Real-Life%20Relationship%20With%20His%20Co-Star" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fthe-truth-about-murphy-from-the-100-s-real-life-relationship-with-his-co-star.html&title=The%20Truth%20About%20Murphy%20From%20The%20100s%20Real-Life%20Relationship%20With%20His%20Co-Star" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-truth-about-murphy-from-the-100-s-real-life-relationship-with-his-co-star.html&description=The%20Truth%20About%20Murphy%20From%20The%20100s%20Real-Life%20Relationship%20With%20His%20Co-Star" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./what-is-the-meaning-behind-cras-est-nostrum-in-national-treasure-the-edge-of-history.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What is The Meaning Behind Cras Est Nostrum In National Treasure The Edge Of History?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./the-style-club-shark-tank-founder-net-worth-and-investment.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Style Club Shark Tank  Founder, Net Worth and Investment">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
