For a while, shows like Hannah Montana, Wizards of Waverly Place, and Suite Life of Zach and Cody dominated TV networks. Then, the channel started wavering in its success, with shows like Jessie and Lab Rats keeping the network relevant. It's still popular today, but it clearly pales in comparison to that era of shows.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, Disney as a company is more popular and trendy than ever. Even with all the CEO drama they have going on at the moment.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>8 Reasons Why Bob Chapek Was Fired At Disney</a></span></p><p>Since those Disney Channel shows faded away, fans have grown up. They haven't forgotten, however, about their favorite childhood stars. One of these is Tyrel Jackson Williams, one of the actors in Lab Rats. Tyrel is one of many child actors who <a href=#>avoided the pitfalls of young fame</a> and is still finding success acting today. He has <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a net worth of $1 million</a> and has rebirthed as a more mature (and funny) actor. He may even become a superstar soon if his career continues to trend in the right direction. Here's what he's been up since his starring role in Lab Rats.</p><h2 id=tyrel-jackson-williams-had-a-small-role-in-the-bachelors><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Tyrel Jackson Williams Had A Small Role In The Bachelors</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/jk-simmons-in-the-bachelor.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>His first notable role after Lab Rats was alongside JK Simmons in the 2017 drama movie The Bachelors. He played a character named Raffi. The movie was an indie film that wasn't exactly huge, but it was Tyrel's first step navigating the aftermath of acting entirely for Disney Channel.</p><h2 id=tyrel-jackson-williams-starred-in-brockmire><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Tyrel Jackson Williams Starred In Brockmire</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/tyrel-jackson-brockmire-hank-azaria.jpg><p>Tyrel's first significant role after Lab Rats was as a main cast member of the TV show Brockmire. Tyrel has <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">truly broken out</a> through his role in Brockmire, primarily as a comedic force. The show's a slight comedy about high school sports, and Tyrel plays the live sports announcer.</p><p>Brockmire has been Tyrel's biggest role as an adult actor, and it's certainly opened the door for bigger and better roles.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tyrel-jackson-williams-starred-in-thunder-force-with-melissa-mccarthy><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Tyrel Jackson Williams Starred In Thunder Force With Melissa McCarthy</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/melissa-mccarthy-shocked-and-terrified.jpg><p>One of these roles has been in the huge comedy film Thunder Force. Tyrel played Jessie, an integral main character for Melissa McCarthy's enormous flick. Jessie is the assistant of Emily, Octavia Spencer's character.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Who Is 'Thunder Force' Actor Tyrel Jackson Williams?</a></span></p><p>It's guaranteed that Tyrel learned a lot from acting in Thunder Force. In this 2021 film, Tyrel got to learn from Melissa and Octavia, two of the most accomplished actresses in the business. Most people know Melissa by name, but they might not recognize Octavia. She just so happens to be the star of the 2011 drama The Help, as well as the 2017 movie Hidden Figures. Octavia was once <a href=#>rescued by Keanu Reeves</a> in the craziest story ever, years before she was famous, which is something she can always hold over the heads of actors she works with.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Melissa McCarthy also has a crazy acting history as well. She's a lighthearted and crazy spirit who does like <a href=#>pulling pranks</a> on her fellow cast members, even for Thunder Force. There's also a strong likelihood she pulled one on Tyrel as well. Maybe Tyrel will continue the tradition of pulling pranks on his fellow cast members in future projects.</p><h2 id=tyrel-jackson-williams-was-in-the-recent-disney-plus-film-hollywood-stargirl><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Tyrel Jackson Williams Was In The Recent Disney Plus Film Hollywood Stargirl</span></h2><p>Hollywood Stargirl isn't the biggest thing Tyrel's starred in over the years, but for those who have seen it, it is one of the best. The 2022 movie got <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a critical rating of 100%</a> from 16 Rotten Tomato critics. The film is a sequel to the 2000 drama Stargirl, an indie movie that also did well with critics.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Tyrel played Terrell, the brother of the secondary character Evan. He got significant screen time in this role, and was one of the three primary characters. He played third wheel to Evan and Stargirl, but fans loved his performance in particular. He even won awards for the film.</p><h2 id=tyrel-jackson-williams-has-a-large-following-on-social-media><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Tyrel Jackson Williams Has A Large Following On Social Media</span></h2><p>All in all, Tyrel's got a promising acting career if he keeps it up. As time goes by, his prestige rises, and the films he stars in get bigger and bigger. Acting isn't all he's done, however. Tyrel also has some serious social media clout.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Disney Channel actor, who's Instagram handle is TJ Will, has over 200 thousand followers on the Facebook-owned picture and video platform. He typically posts pictures of him modeling, but he also will post things commemorating his time on Disney's Lab Rats.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Givenchy Celebrates Walt Disney Co.'s 100th Anniversary With Disney-Themed Capsule Collection</a></span></p><p>Tyrel also posts about his music career. Very recently. Tyrel has engaged himself in a rap career. The songs are definitely mature compared to his innocent Lab Rats beginnings, but it is one of many signs that Tyrel has moved onwards to bigger and better things. His music's also pretty mature and smart overall.</p><h2 id=is-tyrel-jackson-williams-dating-anyone><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Is Tyrel Jackson Williams Dating Anyone?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/tyrel-jackson-williams-on-the-red-carpet.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The biggest question fans have regarding their favorite childhood actors is - who are they dating or married to? In Tyrel's case, it appears he is not dating anyone at the moment. He doesn't have a public record of any exes, though he may keep his relationship status private. He'd be far from the first celebrity to do so.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXanGs7HLZqGam5uovK951qKjpaGRosBurcWtnKtllJ7Ar7HYZpqhmZ6jsq15y5qZZqqRqcBw</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fthis-is-what-tyrel-jackson-williams-has-really-been-up-to-since-lab-rats.html&text=This%20Is%20What%20Tyrel%20Jackson%20Williams%20Has%20Really%20Been%20Up%20To%20Since%20Lab%20Rats&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthis-is-what-tyrel-jackson-williams-has-really-been-up-to-since-lab-rats.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthis-is-what-tyrel-jackson-williams-has-really-been-up-to-since-lab-rats.html&title=This%20Is%20What%20Tyrel%20Jackson%20Williams%20Has%20Really%20Been%20Up%20To%20Since%20Lab%20Rats" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fthis-is-what-tyrel-jackson-williams-has-really-been-up-to-since-lab-rats.html&title=This%20Is%20What%20Tyrel%20Jackson%20Williams%20Has%20Really%20Been%20Up%20To%20Since%20Lab%20Rats" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fthis-is-what-tyrel-jackson-williams-has-really-been-up-to-since-lab-rats.html&title=This%20Is%20What%20Tyrel%20Jackson%20Williams%20Has%20Really%20Been%20Up%20To%20Since%20Lab%20Rats" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthis-is-what-tyrel-jackson-williams-has-really-been-up-to-since-lab-rats.html&description=This%20Is%20What%20Tyrel%20Jackson%20Williams%20Has%20Really%20Been%20Up%20To%20Since%20Lab%20Rats" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./thomas-vanek-net-worth-therichest.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Thomas Vanek Net Worth | TheRichest">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./the-friends-cast-had-an-intervention-for-this-cast-member-s-lateness.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Friends Cast Had An Intervention For This Cast Members Lateness">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
