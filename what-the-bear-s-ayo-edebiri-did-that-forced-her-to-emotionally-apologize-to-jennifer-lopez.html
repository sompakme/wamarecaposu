Despite Adebiri commenting on Lopez's skillset as a vocalist, the 'Get Right' singer accepted a tearful apology from the comedian, who was "mortified" by the situation.</p><p>Jennifer Lopez revealed that the Bottoms actress approached her backstage at the sketch show to apologize. “She was mortified and very sweet,” Lopez said to Variety in a recent interview.</p><p>The Grammy-nominated artist and actress explained, “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">She came to my dressing room and apologized</a> with tears in her eyes, saying how terrible it was that she had said those things.
