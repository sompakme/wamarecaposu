This was because the angst among the characters in the show was something that the target demographic could relate to. And because storylines were juicy, viewers were hooked week after week, making 7th Heaven the most-watched TV show on the WB.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After the show ended, some of the cast struggled with what they were going to do with their lives or careers. Some stars, like <a href=# rel=nofollow>Jessica Biel, went on to work on large-scale projects</a>, and <a href=# rel=nofollow>many guest stars who appeared were already highly famous</a>. One actress that did not fall into this group and knew exactly what she was going to do was Beverley Mitchell.</p><p>Because there was a clear life path Mitchell had drawn out for herself, not only would she be successful professionally but personally as she aged. A feat that is not always easy for those who work in the entertainment industry at an early age. But the Uploaded star was able to transition from a child actor to an adult seamlessly.</p><p>Here is what happened to Beverley Mitchell after 7th Heaven.</p><h2 id=beverley-mitchell-went-to-college-after-7th-heaven>Beverley Mitchell Went To College After 7th Heaven</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/7th-heaven-scene.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When many actors get their foot in the door of the entertainment industry, committing time to get a four-year degree can be difficult to do.</p><p>But for those who take the opportunity to gain that degree, specifically in an industry-related major, it can mean more versatility and skills outside of acting alone. Which is likely why Mitchell chose to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">get her degree in film production</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel=nofollow>What Is Ruthie From '7th Heaven' Doing Now?</a></span></p><p>After graduating from Chaminade College Preparatory School, the Blood Pageant star applied and was accepted into Loyola Marymount University. Not only was Mitchell taking classes while still working on 7th Heaven, but she also eventually graduated with her degree.</p><p>And with having something like film production under her belt, it might mean more clout for opportunities in producing, writing, creating, and directing. All of which Mitchell has thrown herself into in the years since 7th Heaven.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=beverley-mitchell-dabbled-in-the-country-music-industry>Beverley Mitchell Dabbled In The Country Music Industry</h2><p>One dream for Mitchell was to become a female country music singer. As such, when 7th Heaven came to an end, the Candy Cane Christmas star put out an album of all-new country western music, an experience that was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">unlike any other Mitchell had experienced before</a>.</p><p>"I equal it to being naked in front of everybody and just showing your soul and everything you have to the world," Mitchell explained when talking about her foray into music. This is because the Beverley Mitchell singer co-wrote a majority of the songs on her debut album.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Mila Kunis Has A Theory On Why She Was Cast As The 'Bad Girl' On 7th Heaven</a></span></p><p>While life has taken Mitchell in a "different direction" these days, she has not shut the door on writing or singing again. And why would she?</p><p>Her single Angel landed in the top 10 on the Heatseekers chart and the album itself debuted at number 30 on the Billboard Top Country chart. Not bad for someone who had no experience in music before then.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=does-beverley-mitchell-still-act>Does Beverley Mitchell Still Act?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/beverley-mitchell-revealed-jessica-biel-was-annoyed-by-her-during-their-days-on-7th-heaven.jpg><p>Given her experience as a child actor and the fame and notoriety that came with being on 7th Heaven, Mitchell did not have any plans to give up acting after her decade-long series came to an end.</p><p>Since that time, The Secret Life of an American Teenager star has managed to keep her resume current with at least one or more projects per year from 2012 onward.</p><p>Be it The Secret Life of an American Teenager, Hollywood Darlings, a string of Christmas movies, and other projects sprinkled throughout her career over the last decade, Mitchell has managed to keep herself busy.</p><p>Throw in some producing and writing projects as well, and it is clear that the entertainment industry still has a very real interest in the actress.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Does that mean that a reboot is a possibility for 7th Heaven like it was for Full House for Hollywood Darlings' co-star, Jodie Sweetin? As much as fans may like it, <a href=# rel=nofollow>not likely given the controversy that surrounded Stephen Collins, aka, Rev. Eric Camden</a>.</p><p>But if it was up to Mitchell, she loved working on the show so much that she would sign on in a heartbeat to reprise her role as Lucy. The <a href=# rel=nofollow>cast also got along well overall</a>, even though <a href=# rel=nofollow>Jessica Biel was "annoyed by" Mitchell back in the day</a>.</p><h2 id=beverley-mitchell-is-now-married-with-kids-and-a-blog>Beverley Mitchell Is Now Married With Kids (And A Blog)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/beverley-mitchell-with-husband-michael-cameron-and-kids-kenzie-and-hutton.jpg><p>Mitchell and her husband, Michael Cameron have been together for nearly two decades. So long, in fact, that the two became engaged while Mitchell was still filming 7th Heaven.
