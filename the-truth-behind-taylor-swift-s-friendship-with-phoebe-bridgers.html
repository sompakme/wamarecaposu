From her huge fan base to her recent re-recordings of her old albums, she is truly one of a kind.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As for Phoebe Bridgers, she is another musician that has a huge fan base and is loved dearly for her alternative indie music. When the two collaborated on Taylor Swift's re-recording of her fourth studio album Red, fans wanted to know how the two became friends and the story behind their collaboration.</p><h2 id=who-is-phoebe-bridgers-and-how-did-she-meet-taylor-swift>Who Is Phoebe Bridgers (And How Did She Meet Taylor Swift)?</h2><p>Phoebe Bridgers is a fairly new artist to be in the spotlight. She was a member of multiple bands in her youth including, Sloppy Jane until she moved on to a solo career. It wasn't until she released her debut studio album, Stranger in the Alps in 2017, that she gained critical acclaim.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Elton John Needs His Punching Bag After Phoebe Bridgers Was Robbed At Grammys</a></span></p><p>Putting herself even more in the spotlight was her second studio album. <a href=#>Her album Punisher was released in 2020</a>. This ignited her to more mainstream audiences. She received four Grammy nominations after Punisher was released. Between her albums she formed a group called Boygenius with fellow indie musicians, Lucy Dacus and Julien Baker. Together they released an EP in 2018.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Phoebe has been called a "serial collaborator" by critics. She has been on tracks with Fiona Apple, The 1975, Maggie Rogers, Kid Cudi, and most recently Taylor Swift. The announcement of the collaboration of Swift and Bridgers made Swift's re-recorded album highly anticipated by fans of both artists.</p><h2 id=phoebe-bridgers-is-featured-on-taylor-swift-39-s-album-red-taylor-39-s-version>Phoebe Bridgers Is Featured On Taylor Swift's Album, Red (Taylor's Version)</h2><p>In August 2021, Taylor Swift posted to Instagram the track list of Red (Taylor's Version). This included all thirty tracks that would be featured on the re recorded album. This is when it was <a href=#>revealed that Swift and Bridgers teamed up to sing on the track, Nothing New together</a>.</p><p>Fans were able to hear the nostalgic and heartbreaking song not long after it was announced.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This, of course, left fans wondering how the two became friends and decided to work together. During press for Red (Taylor's Version), Taylor revealed on Late Night With Seth Meyers that she reached out to artists she loved asking them to sing her vault tracks with her for the album.</p><p>She even called Phoebe Bridgers one of her favorite artists in the world and said <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"If she sings it, I will listen to it. I just love her voice.”</a></p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Which Taylor Swift Album Is The Most Successful?</a></span></p><p>Phoebe Bridgers also revealed what her first time texting Taylor Swift was like. She called it a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"total high"</a>. Bridgers thought the text was from Aaron Dessner from The National, an artist both Swift and Bridgers have worked with but soon realized it was from Swift herself.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans were shocked to hear that even though they collaborated on Nothing New together, the two have never actually met. Bridgers has said they have only been online friends but can't wait to hang out in person.</p><h2 id=will-the-two-work-together-again-in-the-future>Will The Two Work Together Again In The Future?</h2><p>It has yet to be confirmed if Swift and Bridgers will work together in the future. It is clear that both Swift and Bridgers have a lot of respect and love for each other's music. When asked about Nothing New Bridgers said, “It’s just been a dream" and she <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"couldn't be more excited" about the track."</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Swift has made it clear that she loves both Phoebe as a person and admires her music. Bridgers has done the same for Swift's music. When asked what her favorite Taylor Swift song was, she immediately said the track betty from Swift's 2020 album, folklore.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Many Songs Has Taylor Swift Written?</a></span></p><p>Even though fans wish to see more from the two together, both Swift and Bridgers have a lot going on in their own careers. Bridgers was recently featured on a song called Silk Chiffon by MUNA. The song quickly went viral on TikTok and has been deemed a queer anthem. The music video to go along with it references the cult classic LGBTQ film, But I'm a Cheerleader.</p><p>In 2020, Bridgers created her own record label called Saddest Factory records. She said it has <a href=#>been a dream of hers to have her own record label</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Swift's Red (Taylor's Version) was released not too long ago, but her fans are already wondering what is next for her. Her re-recordings have been a success and <a href=#>fans think either 1989 or Speak Now could be next up for the artist</a>. Who knows, maybe for Swift's next re-recording, Bridgers will be on another vault track. For now, fans can listen to Nothing New and dream of another Taylor Swift and Phoebe Bridger collaboration.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Taylor Swift Teases New Song In Daisy Edgar Jones' New Film Trailer</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirmrGcpL9uv9aina1llqe2prrDrJ%2BiqF2strW0jKmfqJ2Smnqjvsidnp6qo2Q%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fthe-truth-behind-taylor-swift-s-friendship-with-phoebe-bridgers.html&text=The%20Truth%20Behind%20Taylor%20Swift%27s%20Friendship%20With%20Phoebe%20Bridgers&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-truth-behind-taylor-swift-s-friendship-with-phoebe-bridgers.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-truth-behind-taylor-swift-s-friendship-with-phoebe-bridgers.html&title=The%20Truth%20Behind%20Taylor%20Swift%27s%20Friendship%20With%20Phoebe%20Bridgers" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fthe-truth-behind-taylor-swift-s-friendship-with-phoebe-bridgers.html&title=The%20Truth%20Behind%20Taylor%20Swift%27s%20Friendship%20With%20Phoebe%20Bridgers" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fthe-truth-behind-taylor-swift-s-friendship-with-phoebe-bridgers.html&title=The%20Truth%20Behind%20Taylor%20Swift%27s%20Friendship%20With%20Phoebe%20Bridgers" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-truth-behind-taylor-swift-s-friendship-with-phoebe-bridgers.html&description=The%20Truth%20Behind%20Taylor%20Swift%27s%20Friendship%20With%20Phoebe%20Bridgers" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./what-s-in-a-name-david-and-victoria-s-son-romeo-james.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What's in a Name?
