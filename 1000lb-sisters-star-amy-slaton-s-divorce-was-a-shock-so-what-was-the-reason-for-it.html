The following month, Michael filed for divorce in Kentucky.

Last month, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Sun </a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">obtained a police report that revealed Amy called 911</a> on Michael during a February 2023 incident, where she claimed he was acting “violent” and “throwing things” in front of her and their son.</p><p>The report further claimed that Michael became upset after Amy told him she wanted to break-up. “Amy wants to separate, but the male doesn’t want to,” it said.</p><p>Neither Michael nor Amy were under the influence of drugs or alcohol when police arrived at the scene of the domestic dispute. As such, no one was arrested.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Amy later made an official complaint against Michael</a>, accusing him of becoming physically aggressive with their children. She said he was “hitting too hard” when disciplining the boys. “He pulls them by the arm,” Amy stated in court documents. “[Michael] throws things. The night of February of 24, he got mad that I went to take the kids with my sister to eat.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Would Chelsea Houska Ever Return To Teen Mom?

Michael continues to deny Amy’s claims.</p><p>The emergency order was eventually amended to allow <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Michael to have supervised contact with their sons</a>, though he is not allowed to discipline them.

She also said that he doesn’t contribute financially to their family, and rather relies solely on her.</p><p>“He makes me do everything with the house, boys, and has no job,” the reality star explained.</p><p>1,000-lb Sisters is a popular reality television show, even though it’s only in its fourth season. Still, Amy isn’t raking in tens of thousands per episodes like other reality star. It’s estimated she <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">makes around $1,000 to $1,500 per episode</a>, and has a net worth of $250,000.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Fans Can't Make Sense Of This Teen Mom Match, Think Amber Portwood's Storyline Is Shady</a></span></p><h2 id=michael-amp-amy-couldn-rsquo-t-agree-on-how-to-raise-their-kids>Michael & Amy Couldn’t Agree On How To Raise Their Kids</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/4C9C2C9E-1523-43B4-A384-32B62C2078F9.jpeg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While the domestic violence incident may have been recent, Michael and Amy were reportedly having problems for some time. The former couple allegedly butt heads the most on how to raise their young sons.</p><p>According to sources, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Michael didn’t want the boys appearing on 1,000-lb Sisters</a>, despite the show being their biggest source of income, whereas Amy had no problem putting the kids in front of the camera. <strong></strong></p><p>"[Michael] doesn't want the kids to be on the show, but Amy disagrees," one source told Ok! Magazine. "They have been fighting over this for months."</p><p>Additionally, the same source claimed that Amy was bothered by Michael’s lack of involvement with their kids, and that he appeared “jealous” most of her attention was on the boys. The insider said Amy regards Michael as “lazy.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>These themes are nothing new to 1,000-lb Sisters fans, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">who’ve seen Amy and Michael get into conflict when he’s allegedly not pulling his weight</a> since the birth of their youngest son.</p><p>"I walk in the house and it's kinda messy, the way I left it. And I'm like all you do is play video games," Amy said during a 2023 episode. "You can't pick up a room? It must be nice having a vacation. Now I have to clean up after Gage, Glenn and Michael. What the hell? I signed up for two kids."</p><p>Michael and Amy’s divorce is still ongoing, though they both seem eager at this point to end the marriage. There also remains the question of custody over their sons, though Michael retains only limited communication with the boys in supervised circumstances. Though fans will have to wait for future episodes, there’s no doubt that the former couple’s break-up will be discussed in detail on their TLC reality show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGhoaWhgoa9uv8isq56qo2LAta3RZpimsV2ouaLAzqeqZpyZq7yzr8RmrpqrXZZ6tLTOnKJmq59ixKmt02aumqtdqbWmedGemKynnmKzsL6Moqto</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f1000lb-sisters-star-amy-slaton-s-divorce-was-a-shock-so-what-was-the-reason-for-it.html&text=1000lb%20Sisters%20Star%20Amy%20Slatons%20Divorce%20Was%20A%20Shock%2c%20So%20What%20Was%20The%20Reason%20For%20It%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f1000lb-sisters-star-amy-slaton-s-divorce-was-a-shock-so-what-was-the-reason-for-it.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f1000lb-sisters-star-amy-slaton-s-divorce-was-a-shock-so-what-was-the-reason-for-it.html&title=1000lb%20Sisters%20Star%20Amy%20Slatons%20Divorce%20Was%20A%20Shock%2c%20So%20What%20Was%20The%20Reason%20For%20It%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f1000lb-sisters-star-amy-slaton-s-divorce-was-a-shock-so-what-was-the-reason-for-it.html&title=1000lb%20Sisters%20Star%20Amy%20Slatons%20Divorce%20Was%20A%20Shock%2c%20So%20What%20Was%20The%20Reason%20For%20It%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f1000lb-sisters-star-amy-slaton-s-divorce-was-a-shock-so-what-was-the-reason-for-it.html&title=1000lb%20Sisters%20Star%20Amy%20Slatons%20Divorce%20Was%20A%20Shock%2c%20So%20What%20Was%20The%20Reason%20For%20It%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f1000lb-sisters-star-amy-slaton-s-divorce-was-a-shock-so-what-was-the-reason-for-it.html&description=1000lb%20Sisters%20Star%20Amy%20Slatons%20Divorce%20Was%20A%20Shock%2c%20So%20What%20Was%20The%20Reason%20For%20It%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./how-did-kristen-stewart-go-from-bella-swan-to-princess-diana.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How Did Kristen Stewart Go From Bella Swan To Princess Diana?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./danny-gans-dies.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="                  Danny Gans Dies                                                             ">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
