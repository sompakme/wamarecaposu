Their feud traces back to the infamous incident at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, where Kanye notoriously interrupted Taylor’s acceptance speech for Best Female Video, asserting that Beyoncé deserved the award instead.

However, controversy ensued when Kanye claimed that Swift had approved the lyrics, an assertion Taylor has since vehemently denied. The leaked phone call between the two musicians sparked widespread debate and fueled animosity between their fan bases.</p><p>In 2018, the feud reignited when Kanye released the track "Famous," reigniting the controversy surrounding their past interactions. Despite attempts at reconciliation, including an olive branch from Kanye in the form of a public apology, their relationship remained strained.</p><h2 id=kanye-still-managed-to-make-waves-at-the-super-bowl>Kanye Still Managed To Make Waves At The Super Bowl</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/kanye-west-house-lien-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite the allegations, both West and his wife, Bianca, were observed at the Super Bowl, though not in immediate proximity to Swift's suite throughout the event. Notably, West donned his tight black mask (which has become a trademark of his recently), concealing his entire visage, complemented by another black mask featuring a silhouette of Jesus.</p><p>Although West's attempts to disrupt Swift's spotlight were thwarted, he did manage to garner television exposure during the event. Ye capitalized on the Super Bowl platform by securing a 30-second advertisement slot to promote his Yeezy brand, featuring a low-budget video.</p><p>“Hey y’all, this is Ye, and this is my commercial,” Kanye said in the clip, which was filmed in his car. “And since we spent all the money on the commercial spot, we actually – we didn’t spend any money on the actual commercial.
