Beginning professionally in 1986, he starred in the highly controversial drama film Parting Glances where he plays the role of a gay man with AIDS who is still cared for by his ex-boyfriend. Following that, a few of his more popular films include Airheads (1994), starring Adam Sandler and Brendon Fraser, Armageddon (1998) with Bruce Willis and Ben Affleck, and The Island (2005) where he shared the screen with <a href=#>the beautiful vixen Scarlett Johansson</a> and Ewan McGregor. But these are not even a fraction of the many films he has been featured in. So, here are 10 of the highest-grossing Steve Buscemi movies, ranked.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 id=monster-s-university---743-455-million>Monster's University - $743.455 Million</h2><p>It's better late than never for some movie sequels, especially for a movie as unique as Monsters University. Released by <a href=#>Walt Disney Pictures</a> in 2013, the computer-animated monster comedy film is based on the film's original, Monsters, Inc, which was released in 2001. The movie surrounds the lives of fictional characters called Sacarers who are monsters that enter the human realm at night to scare children and harvest the fear in their screams to power the city of Monstropolis. Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal) is a first-grader who has dreams about one day becoming a Scarer and does so when he is older.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There, he meets an old classmate called James "Sully" Sullivan acted by <a href=#>Hollywood mogul John Goodman</a>. They soon become bitter enemies when Sully enters a prestigious sorority with Mike failing to do so. However, they soon end up working together to re-enter Monsters University after being locked out by the MU Scarer Program head, Abigail Hardscrabble (Helen Mirren). Steve Buscemi lends his voice to the supporting role of the antagonist, Randy, and the movie raked in $743.455 million at the box office.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 id=monsters-inc---560-483-million>Monsters Inc.&nbsp; - $560.483 Million</h2><p>Produced by Pixar Animation Studios but released by Walt Disney Pictures, featuring many of the same cast of actors. In the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Monsters, Inc </a><a href=#>computer-animated film</a>, the monsters who are employed as Scarers are aware that their job is dangerous as the children they are trying to scare are considered toxic. However, the children are becoming less easily scared by the monsters, which puts the Monsters, Inc company at risk of failure, and the company's CEO, Henry J. Waternoose (James Coburn) is determined to stop it. When Sully (John Goodman) investigates a door that was left open by his rival, Randall (Steve Buscemi), a two-year-old toddler named Boo (Mary Gibbs) accidentally slips into Monstropolis. He alerts his pal Mike, <a href=#>voiced by Billy Crystal</a> to help him hide her and realizes that she isn't toxic at all. Rather, her laugh exudes more power than her scream. The film grossed $560.483 million at the global box office.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 id=armageddon---554-6-million>Armageddon - $554.6 Million</h2><p>It helps to have someone as funny as Steve Buscemi while the Earth is under an impending meteor strike, and that's why he was featured in the 1998 science fiction disaster film, Armageddon. After a meteor shower destroys <a href=#>NASA's Space Shuttle</a> Atlantis, they discover that an asteroid the size of Texas is hurtling toward Earth with only eighteen days before impact. In an attempt to stop it, NASA executive Dan Truman (Billy Bob Thornton) assembles a team of astronauts led by an oil driller named Harry Stamper played by Hollywood legend Bruce Willis and his oil team, Chick Chapel (Will Patton), Bear (Michael Clarke Duncan), A.J. Frost (Ben Affleck), and geologists Rockhound (Steve Buscemi) and Oscar, played by <a href=#>Hollywood's bad boy Owen Wilson</a>. Their mission consists of flying into space and drilling a hole into the center of the asteroid and inserting a nuclear bomb that will detonate and split it in half. The action-packed film grossed $554.6 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 id=the-boss-baby---527-965-million>The Boss Baby - $527.965 Million</h2><p>If there's one thing that can be said about Buscemi it's that he's always a part of high-earning movies. And the 2017 computer-animated comedy,<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> The Boss Baby,</a> was no different. The film follows a young man named Timothy Templeton, <a href=#>voiced over by Tobey Maguire</a> that craved his parent's attention. But when a new baby, Theodore "Ted" Templeton aka The Boss Baby (Alec Baldwin) enters the family, he threatens to snatch that attention away from him. Tim quickly learns that the seemingly innocent Baby acts, speaks, and thinks like a grown-up when their parents Theodore Templeton Sr. (Jimmy Kimmel) and Janice Templeton (<a href=#>Lisa Kudrow</a>), aren't looking. Baby later reveals to Tim that he is on a mission to find out the world's love of babies is threatened by a love for puppies, and he chose Tim's parents because they work for Puppy Co., whose CEO is Francis E. Francis (Steve Buscemi), Boss Baby's nemesis. The film went on to gross $527.965 million at the box office.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 id=hotel-transylvania-3---527-848-million>Hotel Transylvania 3 - $527.848 Million</h2><p>It appears that all Hollywood celebrities have to do if they appear to be out of their acting prime is lend their voice to a computer-animated film and they're guaranteed to make bank! <a href=#>Kristen Wiig knows this all too well, as her highest-grossing films</a> are all animation films. So, in 2018, Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation was released with an exciting blend of comedians, actors, and even music stars.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The computer-animated monster comedy focuses on Count Dracula (Adam Sandler), his daughter Mavis Dracula (Selena Gomez), her husband Johnny Loughran (Andy Samberg), and their friends Frankenstein (Kevin James), Griffin <a href=#>voiced by David Spade</a>, Murray (Keegan-Michael Key), and Wayne the werewolf played by Steve Buscemi. Set in 1897, Dracula and his friends travel in disguise on a train to Budapest but are found out by Professor Abraham Van Helsing (Jim Gaffigan) who always fails to catch Dracula. Against a budget of just $80 million, the film grossed an easy $527.848 million.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Top 10 Best Steve Buscemi On-Screen Deaths</a></span></p><h2 id=hotel-transylvania-2---469-831-million>Hotel Transylvania 2 - $469.831 Million</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Naturally, most of the "Bad Boys of SNL" crew were accompanying each other in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hotel Transylvania 2,</a> released in 2015. In this film series, Dracula's daughter Mavis, <a href=#>voiced by superstar singer Selena Gomez</a> and his new son-in-law Johnny (Andy Samberg) get married and soon invite a baby boy named Dennis into the family. When Dennis turns five years old, he has yet to grow fangs and Dracula fears that he won't inherit his vampire powers. Along with Frankenstein (Kevin James), Wayne (Steve Buscemi), Griffin (Invisible Man), and Murray (Keegan-Michael Key), Dracula tries to employ scare tactics to force the vampiric qualities in Dennis to come out, to no avail. Dracula's father, Vlad (Mel Brooks) even tries to induce fear so the child's teeth will show. The film was a success, grossing $469.831 million globally.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 id=g-force---292-817-million>G-Force - $292.817 Million</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Spy comedies are one genre of film that would never get old, regardless of whether it's Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker or <a href=#>Jason Statham and Melissa McCarthy.</a> However, in 2009, director Hoyt Yeatman changed the narrative a bit by having the film revolve around a team of trained, dangerous animals, namely three guinea pigs: Darwin (Sam Rockwell), Blaster (Tracy Morgan), and Juarez (Penelope Cruz), not forgetting a mole named Speckles (Nicolas Cage) and a fly named Mooch (Dee Bradley Baker). After being commissioned by their leader, Ben Kendall <a href=#>played by Hangover's Zach Galifianakis</a> to infiltrate the residence of Leonard Saber (Bill Nighy), they end up trapped in a pet store with a guinea pig named Hurley (Jon Favreau), a hamster named Bucky (Steve Buscemi), and three mice. The film grossed $292.817 million worldwide.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 id=grown-ups-2---247-023-million>Grown Ups 2 - $247.023 Million</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A few years after the release of the original Grown Ups film in 2010, the group of inseparable high school buddies are closer than ever as Lenny Fader (Adam Sandler) relocated his family closer to his Stanton hometown. The friends are all going through somewhat of a mid-life crisis, with Lenny's wife Roxanne (<a href=#>Salma Hayek</a>) wanting another baby that he doesn't want; Eric (Kevin James) constantly has to creep into his mother's house to spend time with her unaware to his wife Sally (Maria Bello); Kurt's (Christ Rock) wife Deanne (Maya Rudolph) forgets their anniversary, and Marcus (David Spade) is made to bond with his criminal son from a past fling. Amid all this, they're trying to set an example as real men for their children to follow while enjoying their adult lives. Grown Ups 2 was a success, grossing $247.023 million at the box office.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=big-daddy---228-641-million>Big Daddy - $228.641 Million</h2><p>In the 1999 comedy film,<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Big Daddy,</a> viewers see a much <a href=#>younger Adam Sandler</a> playing the role of Sonny Koufax, a 32-year-old who has the potential to be a lawyer but instead chooses to work one day a week as a toll booth attendant and survive off a $200,000 compensation from an accident. After his girlfriend, Corinne (Leslie Mann) dumps him for a more responsible, much older man, he inadvertently becomes the guardian of a five-year-old named Julian McGrath who arrived on his doorstep with a note claiming that Sonny's roommate, Kevin (Jon Stewart). <a href=#>Rob Schneider plays the role</a> of Nazo, Sonny delivery guy, and best friend, and Steve Buscemi also acts as a homeless man who ran away from his father. The film teaches the importance of fatherhood and grossed $228.641 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 id=con-air---224-117-million>Con Air - $224.117 Million</h2><p>There is no shortage of roles that Steve Buscemi can act in. From a gay man with AIDS to a diamond thief in <a href=#>Quentin Tarantino's</a> Reservoir Dogs starring Sean Penn, to a serial killer named Garland "The Marietta Mangler" in Con Air - it seems he can do it all. The movie Con Air surrounds the life of Army Sgt. Cameron Poe (Nicolas Cage), who is given ten years for accidentally killing one of the three men who tried to assault his wife, Tricia (Monica Potter). Some of the criminals, including Cameron, are transported to a Jailbird prison transport airplane with U.S. Marshal Vince Larkin played by actor an<a href=#>d activist John Cusack </a>overseeing the place. Garland (Steve Buscemi), Cyrus (John Malkovich), and other inmates overtake the aircraft and give everyone the ride of their lives!
