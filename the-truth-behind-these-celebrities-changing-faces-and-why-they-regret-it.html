It can never be easy seeing yourself age slowly on the big screen.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A number of celebrities are now speaking out about Botox and their regret in having it done so young. Sometimes it is because the procedure goes very wrong, sometimes it is due to side effects, but mostly it's because the star didn't enjoy the way their face changed after Botox.</p><p>Many celebrities who speak out against procedures say they’re not judgmental about others within the industry who have chosen to have surgery or fillers, but just haven't enjoyed their personal experience using injectables to smooth our thin lines.</p><h2 id=courteney-cox-regrets-her-plastic-surgery><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Courteney Cox Regrets Her Plastic Surgery</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/hc7x9v8dida4gzjeqt4xtd.jpg><p>The Friends star has been candid in regretting the amount of plastic surgery and Botox she has had on her face. Courteney Cox admits the quest to stay young led to her making some poor decisions.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">I grew up thinking that appearance was the most important thing</a>. That’s kind of sad because it got me in trouble. I was trying so hard to keep up, and I actually made things worse,” she explained to New Beauty, admitting doctors pressured her into getting more than she originally wanted.</p><p>“The next thing you know, you’re layered and layered and layered. You have no idea because it’s gradual until you go, ‘Oh s***, this doesn’t look right.’ And it’s worse in pictures than in real life,” Scream star Cox said. “I have one friend who was like, ‘Whoa, no more!’ I thought, I haven’t done anything in six months. I didn’t realize.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I’ve had all my fillers dissolved. I’m as natural as I can be. I feel better because I look like myself. I think that I now look more like the person that I was,” Cox added. “I hope I do. Things are going to change. Everything’s going to drop. I was trying to make it not drop, but that made me look fake. You need movement in your face, especially if you have thin skin like I do. Those aren’t wrinkles — they’re smile lines. I’ve had to learn to embrace movement and realize that fillers are not my friend.”</p><p>She spoke recently on the Gloss Angeles podcast about dissolving all her fillers: “Thank God they are removable,” she continued. “I messed up a lot and now luckily … I was able to reverse most of that.”</p><h2 id=has-cameron-diaz-ever-had-botox><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Has Cameron Diaz Ever Had Botox?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Cameron-Diaz-Quits-Acting.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Charlie’s Angels actress admitted she once dabbled in injectables but wasn’t a fan.</p><p>“I’ve tried [Botox] before, where it was like a little tiny touch of something. It changed my face in such a weird way that I was like, ‘No, I don’t want to be like that,’” Cameron Diaz told Entertainment Tonight in 2014. “I’d rather see my face aging than a face that doesn’t belong to me at all.”</p><p>Cameron Diaz doesn’t judge anyone who wants to go under the needle. “They’re to help people feel a little better about themselves,” she told the Huffington Post in May 2016.</p><p>“If they do feel better about themselves, then those procedures have worked. I have no problem with that. And [in] a lot of instances, it does make you look like you’ve taken a nap … or that you might be a little younger than you looked maybe the day before.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=has-stevie-nicks-had-work-done><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Has Stevie Nicks Had Work Done?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/stevie-nicks-performing.jpg><p>“Let me tell you, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Botox only makes you look like you’re in a satanic cult</a>,” the Fleetwood Mac's Stevie Nicks told the Guardian in 2020.</p><p>“I only had it once and it destroyed my face for four months.

I’m not into all that stuff.”</p><p>She doesn't regret trying to maintain her youth “I think a little bit of maintenance is good. There are things we can do to perk ourselves up.
