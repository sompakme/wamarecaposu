Reuniting with her old friend Monica Geller and her group of friends, Rachel learns to stand on her own two feet.

At the intervention, Lisa Kudrow, who played Phoebe Buffay, reportedly told Aniston, “You have bad luck getting to work.”</p><p>We don’t have much more detail as to what was said during the intervention, but the process worked.
