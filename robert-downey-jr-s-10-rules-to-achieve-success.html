With his sprawling success over the past decade, the actor has cultivated different rules to achieve success in life.</p><p><a href=#>Robert Downey Jr</a>. began acting at the age of 5 when his father, an Underground filmmaker, made him perform for his movie. After working steadily since high school, RDJ was shot to recognition from his 1992 biopic Chaplin. Around the same time, the actor also suffered through substance abuse problems, which negatively impacted his acting career. In 1999, his drug addiction problem even landed him in jail for a year. The actor found steady success after acting in a recurring role on the TV show Ally McBeal. Once he became sober in 2003, the actor delved into work and made 15 movies until 2008. That year, the actor received the <a href=#>role of Tony Stark for Iron Man</a>, and the rest is cinema history.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>From going to prison for breaking parole to becoming one of the highest-paid actors with $300 net worth, there are a lot of lessons to learn from RDJ and his life behind the camera. Let’s take a look at the 10 Rules Of Success by Robert Downey Jr.</p><h2 id=accepting-help>Accepting Help</h2><p>Robert Downey Jr. had always been reluctant to accept help. However, things changed for him when production studios were hesitant to hire him due to his drug addiction problems. One of RDJ’s co-stars from the 1990 movie Air America Mel Gibson, offered help. He gave an insurance bond for RDJ, which landed him a lead role in the movie The Singing Detective in 2003.</p><h2 id=letting-talent-overlook-the-past-mistakes>Letting Talent Overlook The Past Mistakes</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As a recovering drug addict, RDJ was the least likely choice for the lead role in the 2008 <a href=#>blockbuster Marvel movie</a> Iron Man. Jon Favreau, the Director of the movie, decided to give him a chance and ignore the mistakes he had made in the past, which ultimately paid off a great deal, as noted by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Entrepreneur</a>.</p><h2 id=developing-discipline-over-time>Developing Discipline Over Time</h2><p>Sober since 2003, Robert Downey Jr. developed a discipline in his lifestyle through the Chinese martial art technique Wing Chun which cultivated inner calm inside him and made him focus internally on himself. The actor is known to take at least three to five lessons in a week and even takes his instructor to visit his movie sets.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>‘The Rock’ Way: Dwayne Johnson's Top 10 Rules For Success</a></span></p><h2 id=working-together-in-harmony-in-an-ensemble>Working Together In Harmony In An Ensemble</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even as the pioneer who gave a jumpstart to <a href=#>the Marvel franchise</a> that has collectively earned over $22.93 billion through all movies combined, RDJ takes a step back and lets the other actors have their moment in the spotlight. He is known to fit into every Director’s vision rather than making it about himself.</p><h2 id=be-passionate-about-work>Be Passionate About Work</h2><p>RDJ has come to terms that one can achieve peace of mind, no matter what stories are created in the past. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Success 4</a>, the actor has said that it is important to be passionate about doing the work a person loves. It is important to take ample time to think through before choosing a path.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=give-people-a-good-show>Give People A Good Show</h2><p>Everywhere RDJ goes, he makes his presence known. He knows the effect he has on people and how important it is to be your best version for everyone.

While he is known to have a glamorous and over-the-top persona, the actor credits his family life to keep him down-to-earth and humble. He isn’t the most sought-after star but just a regular man at home.</p><h2 id=resisting-the-urge-to-chase-money>Resisting The Urge To Chase Money</h2><p>The most important part of life, according to Robert Downey Jr., is to stay positive and limit the negative thoughts in the head. Pushing towards doing the right thing will ultimately lead to fulfilling goals rather than chasing the greed to earn money in life, as noted by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mulligan Brothers</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=have-fun>Have Fun</h2><p>The most important lesson that Robert Downey Jr. has learned through his portrayal in several Marvel and other projects is that the passion for work should be equal parts of dedication and fun. The important part of life is to enjoy it to the fullest and never take a moment for granted. The actor believes that enjoying life, meeting fans, and helping people can be a lot more fun than anybody might think!</p><p>Robert Downey Jr.’s life story is one of inspiration, hard work, and genuine passion for the work he does.
