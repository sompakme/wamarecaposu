In general, The Big Bang Theory seemed to have a friendly and positive cast who loved being together on set. Even back in 2016, when Rauch starred in the movie The Bronze, Bialik interviewed her about the project for the website Kveller.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In April 2019, when the sitcom was ending, Bilak shared a beautiful message about Rauch on her Instagram account. She summed up the good times they had shared together and it sounded like she really cared about her costar.</p><p>She wrote, "This lady and I have been through a lot together as the new kids on the block of season 3 of [Big Bang Theory]. We have cried together and laughed together and raised kids on a set together. I couldn't have made it without her with any semblance of sanity. Thank you [themelissarauch] for being you.

In August 2020, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mayim Bialik talked about The Big Bang Theory cast</a> in an interview with Us Weekly, and Rauch was one of the actors that she mentioned.</p><p>Bialik said, “Melissa [Rauch] [and] I [have] talked to Simon [Helberg]. I actually wrote a screenplay and I’ve been wanting to cast him in this screenplay, so I was able to do that. I don’t know if we’ll get to make the movie ‘cause quarantine.” She also mentioned that Jim Parsons was a producer on her sitcom Call Me Kat, which enabled them to stay in contact with each other.</p><p>In a 2020 interview with Fox News, Bialik said "I talk to Melissa most often."

She was honest about the reality of the situation and said, "It’s obviously different to have a relationship with people when the thing that brought you together doesn't exist. We don't have a place to go to work together to hang out. We've had some group communication for sure."</p><p>While of course she was totally right, it's still bittersweet to think about the show ending.

It's hard to imagine Melissa Rauch and her co-stars ever fighting or deciding that they don't want to be friends anymore. They shared something special and it doesn't sound like they will ever forget the experience of starring in The Big Bang Theory together.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGigrGWdmrmqv9KaZKuZpZi1brLRopynnKNixKrAx2aZop9dl66vs4ytn56noq56pLuMrKuaqqNirqfAxKtkqaSRrravs4ybnKumkZmytcDEaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fis-melissa-rauch-still-friends-with-her-co-stars-after-playing-bernadette-on-the-big-bang-theory.html&text=Is%20Melissa%20Rauch%20Still%20Friends%20With%20Her%20Co-Stars%20After%20Playing%20Bernadette%20On%20The%20Big%20Bang%20Theory%3f%20&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fis-melissa-rauch-still-friends-with-her-co-stars-after-playing-bernadette-on-the-big-bang-theory.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fis-melissa-rauch-still-friends-with-her-co-stars-after-playing-bernadette-on-the-big-bang-theory.html&title=Is%20Melissa%20Rauch%20Still%20Friends%20With%20Her%20Co-Stars%20After%20Playing%20Bernadette%20On%20The%20Big%20Bang%20Theory%3f%20" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fis-melissa-rauch-still-friends-with-her-co-stars-after-playing-bernadette-on-the-big-bang-theory.html&title=Is%20Melissa%20Rauch%20Still%20Friends%20With%20Her%20Co-Stars%20After%20Playing%20Bernadette%20On%20The%20Big%20Bang%20Theory%3f%20" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fis-melissa-rauch-still-friends-with-her-co-stars-after-playing-bernadette-on-the-big-bang-theory.html&title=Is%20Melissa%20Rauch%20Still%20Friends%20With%20Her%20Co-Stars%20After%20Playing%20Bernadette%20On%20The%20Big%20Bang%20Theory%3f%20" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fis-melissa-rauch-still-friends-with-her-co-stars-after-playing-bernadette-on-the-big-bang-theory.html&description=Is%20Melissa%20Rauch%20Still%20Friends%20With%20Her%20Co-Stars%20After%20Playing%20Bernadette%20On%20The%20Big%20Bang%20Theory%3f%20" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./justin-timberlake-s-past-infidelity-claims-leave-a-dark-mark-on-his-relationship-with-jessica-biel.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Justin Timberlake's Past Infidelity Claims Leave A Dark Mark On His Relationship With Jessica Biel">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./how-howard-stern-almost-hooked-up-with-joan-rivers.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How Howard Stern Almost Hooked Up With Joan Rivers">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
