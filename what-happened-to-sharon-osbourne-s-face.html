Well, before we discuss the botched procedure, we should discuss why it took place to begin with. According to Sharon, she decided to do work on her face years ago, for the simple fact that she wanted to look better. According to her words alongside Daily Mail, <a href=#>she did it for herself and nobody else.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"'For me,' she says quickly.

Looking back, once again Sharon wasn't thrilled with how it all went down, especially given that her face went completely numb, and she couldn't feel her face. She revealed the details on 'The Kelly Clarkson Show'.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I had this thing where they lifted up my mouth and then for the first like week I'm like I couldn't feel my mouth, I can hardly feel my mouth now, to be honest with you."</p><p>"I couldn't find my mouth.
