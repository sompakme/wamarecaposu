He derived the name Post from his last name, while Malone was used via a random generator. <a href=#>Post Malone has been a consistent artist</a> as he released a string of successful songs, including Congratulations, Rockstar, Goodbyes, Circles, and many more. Long before singing at sold-out concerts, <a href=#>Post Malone</a> was an average kid who struggled to find a place for himself. He went through several life transitions and hurdles to stand at the top.</p><p>Post Malone has had a colorful life, a successful rapper, and producer who also dipped his toes into business ventures. Beyond his music, Malone has also endorsed various brands that he believes in and has made several investments that have raked his net worth to $45 million. Here’s a look at how Post Malone went from being a shy kid to one of the biggest artists in the world.</p><h2 id=from-texas-to-los-angeles>From Texas To Los Angeles</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Born in 1995, Post Malone was raised by his father, Rich Post, and his stepmother. His father, being a Disc Jockey, was the first to introduce a young Post Malone to various genres of music like hip-hop, rock, and country. He moved to Texas at the age of nine after his father was offered a position as concessions manager at the Dallas Cowboys stadium.</p><p>He learned to play the guitar at the age of 15 after watching the Guitar Hero video,’ as noted by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Famous People</a>. The same year he auditioned for a rock band in Texas but was rejected. While he attended community college, Post Malone worked at Chicken Express, but not for long. He moved to Los Angeles soon after to establish his career.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2015, Post Malone wrote the song White Iverson in his small LA apartment when he didn’t even have enough money to buy a pack of cigarettes. After the song was released, it hit more than one million views, and he gained some popularity in the music industry which led to his deal with Republic Records. He met <a href=#>Kanye West</a> when he performed at Kylie Jenner’s 18th birthday party and impressed West with his performance.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Star-Studded Dinners: 10 Most Popular Restaurants For Celebrity-Spotting In LA, Hollywood</a></span></p><p>West asked Post Malone to collaborate on his single Fade, which led to further features with Young Thug and 50 Cent. In 2016, he went on tour with Justin Bieber during his Purpose era and performed opening acts worldwide. His first album Stoney was released in 2016 which debuted at No. 6 on US Billboard 200.</p><p>As mentioned by<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Billboard</a>, his second album Beerbongs and Bentleys was an even bigger hit, and his single Rockstar debuted at <a href=#>No. 1 on the Billboard</a> charts and retained the position for eight consecutive weeks. Dubbed as the ‘Donald Trump Of Hip-Hop’ by his record label Executive, Post Malone has not only faced a round of controversies but has also struggled with mental issues over the years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-other-side-of-fame>The Other Side Of Fame</h2><p>Post Malone has been part of controversies for being a white rapper and being a rich kid who bought his way into music. However, Malone has refused such claims over time. Coming from humble family background, he never had a luxurious life growing up. While these controversies would usually kill the person’s career, Malone has only received more success which is often be compared to Donald Trump’s presidency tenure.</p><p>Apart from the public issues, Post Malone has always grappled with the ability to overcome his insecurities. His face tattoos have always been the talk of the town, and while they seem like a reckless choice, Post Malone claims to <a href=#>have those tattoos</a> because he doesn’t like his face. His tattoos reflect his mental health struggles, his muses, and his history, as stated by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Men’s Health</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The artist has also faced anxiety issues from his teens and suffered a marijuana-induced anxiety attack which he no longer smokes. After the death of his good friends Juice WLRD, Mac Miller, and Lil Peep due to drugs, Post Malone has become more aware of his mental struggles and has taken medical attention. Since middle school, he claims to have had anxiety issues when he would cry himself to sleep every night. While he overcomes his issues, Malone hasn’t shone away from his music and has continually produced hard-selling albums.</p><h2 id=an-uphill-climb>An Uphill Climb</h2><p>His 2019 album Hollywood’s Bleeding debuted right at the No. 1 position with six successful singles. Apart from his music career, Post Malone has an avid interest in the business. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, he bought a portion of an equity stake in Envy Gaming, a sports organization.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Being an avid gamer and from Texas, he invested in the Dallas-based company and announced his involvement in 2020 before the Call Of Duty league began. He also launched his line of Rose Wine called ‘Maison No. 9’, which he heavily promotes on his social media handles.</p><p>The newest venture that <a href=#>Post Malone</a> is trying to promote is his own sports league for beer pong. While the artist has filed a petition with the Trademark and Patent Office in the United States, the league is supposed to have tournaments, competitions, and exhibitions involving beer pong.</p><p>A man of many eclectic tastes, Post Malone, has faced a few minor roadblocks on his path to success. Post Malone has gained success while openly discussing his struggles in the music industry, from his first single that made him famous to his ever-growing fan base. Despite the myriads of troubles, he has managed to create the best head-bopping pop anthems.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>Post Malone's Purest Tweets That Make Us Love Him Even More</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Famous People</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Billboard</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Men’s Health</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Hollywood Reporter</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGSzprHLoqWgZZyeuKZ5wGapqJubqMGivoyhnKudo2K1sMOMqaasrF2irq27zZ5kppmUmnqqwIytpmasmJp6tbvPaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fhere-s-how-post-malone-made-it-to-the-top.html&text=Here%27s%20How%20Post%20Malone%20Made%20It%20To%20The%20Top&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhere-s-how-post-malone-made-it-to-the-top.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhere-s-how-post-malone-made-it-to-the-top.html&title=Here%27s%20How%20Post%20Malone%20Made%20It%20To%20The%20Top" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fhere-s-how-post-malone-made-it-to-the-top.html&title=Here%27s%20How%20Post%20Malone%20Made%20It%20To%20The%20Top" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fhere-s-how-post-malone-made-it-to-the-top.html&title=Here%27s%20How%20Post%20Malone%20Made%20It%20To%20The%20Top" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhere-s-how-post-malone-made-it-to-the-top.html&description=Here%27s%20How%20Post%20Malone%20Made%20It%20To%20The%20Top" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./kelsea-ballerini-is-the-new-face-of-covergirl-details.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kelsea Ballerini Is the New Face of CoverGirl: Details">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./cale-hoover-net-worth-how-much-is-hoover-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Cale Hoover Net Worth  How Much is Hoover Worth?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
