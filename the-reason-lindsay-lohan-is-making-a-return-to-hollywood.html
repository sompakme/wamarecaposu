Her early beginnings on television gave way to movie stardom and she was elevated to celebrity status. Lohan soon became a tabloid fixture and made headlines for all the wrong reasons.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Her personal struggles were exploited for entertainment and she struggled publicly with addiction. These problems were also effecting her career. Stories of unprofessional behavior caused her to lose her reputation in Hollywood. For a long time, it seemed like Lohan's acting career was finished.</p><p>However, Lohan is set to star in a new movie for Netflix this year titled Falling for Christmas, out November 10. Netflix also announced a creative partnership with Lohan for two films. Here is the story of how <a href=#>Lohan</a> reignited her acting career after so many counted her out.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lindsay-lohan-grew-to-stardom-as-a-child-star>Lindsay Lohan Grew To Stardom As A Child Star</h2><p>Lindsay Lohan was raised on Long Island, NY and started her career as a child. She signed with Ford Models at the age of three, modeling for Calvin Klein Kids and Abercrombie. She also appeared in several television commercials from Wendy's to Pizza Hut. At the age of 10, she acted in the soap opera Another World.</p><p>Her acting talent was already being noticed and she soon landed her big break in The Parent Trap. The Disney remake features Lohan starring as a pair of twins trying to get their divorced parents back together. The film was a huge success and Lohan became a celebrity overnight. She later played Bette Midler's daughter in the sitcom Bette, but <a href=#>left the show when the production moved from New York to Los Angeles</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Much Was Lindsay Lohan Paid For The Planet Fitness Commercial?</a></span></p><p>After two made-for-TV movies, Life Size and Get a Clue, Lohan found success with another Disney remake. In 2003, Lohan starred opposite Jamie Lee Curtis in Freaky Friday. The film was another hit for Lohan and she was now seen as someone with potential for a long career. After Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen, Lohan starred in perhaps her most famous movie, Mean Girls, in 2004.</p><p>That film put Lohan on the map and made people recognize her star power. It has gone on to become a cult classic. It's constantly referenced in pop culture and it has lived on through memes on the internet. The smart writing and incredible cast gave this film longevity that ensures it will be discussed for a very long time,</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It looked like Lohan could do no wrong, but she was about to face some very rough roads ahead.</p><h2 id=lindsay-lohan-struggled-behind-the-scenes>Lindsay Lohan Struggled Behind The Scenes</h2><p>In 2004, Lohan ventured into music with her debut album "Speak." She signed to Casablanca Records with Tommy Mottola leading the way. The single "Rumors" became Lohan's first official single and music video. Her sophomore album, "A Little More Personal (Raw)," was released a year later.</p><p>The album's single, "Confessions of a Broken Heart (Daughter to Father)," was a look at the dark side of her private life that was starting to become very public. In this case, her strained relationship with her father Michael, who was divorced from Lohan's mother Dina.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Over the next several years, many incidents made headlines surrounding Lohan's partying and unprofessional behavior. On the set of Georgia Rule in 2006, <a href=#>Lohan was reprimanded in a letter</a> by studio executive James G. Robinson. He said there were several times Lohan was late to set and many times she didn't show up at all.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Lindsay Lohan Is Officially A Married Woman!</a></span></p><p>In 2007, Lohan was arrested for the first time for driving under the influence. This set in motion a series of arrests, court dates, and jail sentences. There were also many trips to rehab and many failed attempts at an acting comeback. For a long time, it seemed like everything Lohan touched was damaged by scandal.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2013, she sat down for an interview with Oprah Winfrey where she admitted to being an alcoholic. The following year, Lohan starred in a docuseries for OWN chronicling her return following her most recent stint in rehab. The series, however, showed more unprofessional behavior from Lohan and a meeting with Winfrey where she told her to get her act together.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Happened Between Lindsay Lohan and Netflix?</a></span></p><h2 id=the-real-reason-lindsay-lohan-is-making-a-return>The Real Reason Lindsay Lohan Is Making A Return</h2><p>In order to get a hold of her life and sobriety, Lohan moved to Dubai. <a href=#>Lohan has spoken about the lack of paparazzi</a> and media attention being another reason for her living there. In 2018, she opened a beach resort on the Greek island Mykonos and starred in the MTV reality show, Lindsay Lohan's Beach Club, which focused on it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, many wondered if she would ever get back to acting. Those questions would soon be put to rest in 2021 when <a href=#>Netflix announced Lohan would star in a new film</a>, Falling For Christmas. The trailer was released this month. It is a romantic comedy set for release on November 10. Netflix also <a href=#>announced a creative partnership with Lohan</a> where she will star in two new films.</p><p>Lindsay Lohan is a talented actress that has grown up in the spotlight. Her journey has been a tough one to follow, but the public continues to root for her. She is someone many people have grown up with. While she may have gone through rough periods, her talent continues to impress audiences. That is the reason she has been able to bounce back and return to her acting roots.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdobavsNKasGakn52ur3nRnquuqp6asW7AzmafqKScrsSwu8No</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fthe-reason-lindsay-lohan-is-making-a-return-to-hollywood.html&text=The%20Reason%20Lindsay%20Lohan%20Is%20Making%20A%20Return%20To%20Hollywood&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-reason-lindsay-lohan-is-making-a-return-to-hollywood.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-reason-lindsay-lohan-is-making-a-return-to-hollywood.html&title=The%20Reason%20Lindsay%20Lohan%20Is%20Making%20A%20Return%20To%20Hollywood" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fthe-reason-lindsay-lohan-is-making-a-return-to-hollywood.html&title=The%20Reason%20Lindsay%20Lohan%20Is%20Making%20A%20Return%20To%20Hollywood" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fthe-reason-lindsay-lohan-is-making-a-return-to-hollywood.html&title=The%20Reason%20Lindsay%20Lohan%20Is%20Making%20A%20Return%20To%20Hollywood" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-reason-lindsay-lohan-is-making-a-return-to-hollywood.html&description=The%20Reason%20Lindsay%20Lohan%20Is%20Making%20A%20Return%20To%20Hollywood" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./what-happened-to-olivia-miles-notre-dame-tooth-find-her-face-photos-on-instagram.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What Happened To Olivia Miles Notre Dame Tooth?
