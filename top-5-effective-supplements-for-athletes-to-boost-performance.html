For example, branched-chain amino acids supplements are associated with muscle growth, improving endurance, and enhanced muscle recovery.</p><p>It’s not enough that supplements contain these ingredients. They also need to be in the bioavailable form to be absorbed quickly and efficiently.</p><p>Therefore, supplements with a high <a href=# rel=noopener>bioavailability</a> were favored as they reduce the chances of the nutrients being destroyed before they reach the bloodstream. The formulation of a supplement can improve its bioavailability, as can the delivery method. For example, capsules are often more effective than tablets.</p><h3>Reputation and Customer Reviews</h3><p>It’s important that the supplement brands we chose had a good standing within the athletic community. While we noted testimonials on the brand’s websites, we also combed through independent and verified reviews online. This was to make sure customers were happy with the supplements, and that side effects were minimal and temporary.</p><h3>Ingredients</h3><p>Many athletes take sports supplements daily, so they mustn’t contain any nasty toxins or chemicals in the formulations. The brands on our list favor all-natural ingredients that are organic and therefore are entirely safe to consume and stack together.</p><p>Additionally, we looked for brands that took an eco-friendly and sustainable approach to sourcing ingredients and giving back to the environment as opposed to solely taking from it.</p><h2>FAQs About Supplements for Athletes</h2><h3>What are the best vitamins for athletes?</h3><p>Several vitamins and other ingredients can help boost performance, support healthy muscle growth, or aid recovery. Take a look at some of the best in the table below.</p><table><tbody readability=13><tr><td>Supplement</td><td>Sport Discipline</td><td>Benefits</td></tr><tr readability=9><td>Creatine</td><td>Power sports, such as weightlifting, sprinting,&nbsp; throwing, and high-intensity training</td><td>Aids muscles performance in short bouts of intense effort, as well as supporting cognitive function</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Fish oils</td><td>Recovery</td><td>May help prevent or reduce muscle soreness and inhibit muscle tightness and poor range of movement after exercise</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Whey protein</td><td>Muscle growth</td><td>Can help support the maintenance of muscle mass and growth</td></tr><tr readability=9><td>Fatty acids</td><td>Endurance, such as running, rowing, and swimming</td><td>Omega-3 fatty acids can act as a vasodilator, which may help increase oxygen supply to skeletal muscle during exercise</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Vitamin D</td><td>Recovery</td><td>Vitamin D supports the cardiovascular and immune system as well as decreasing oxidative stress after exercise.</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Do elite athletes take supplements?</h3><p>While elite athletes can perform well and build muscle without supplements. However, as athletes push their bodies to the limits, supplements may help provide a boost to energy levels, muscle power, aerobic capacity, and recovery.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Data suggests</a> that elite athletes use dietary supplements more than their non-elite counterparts. This could be because for an individual to perform at their best. They require a certain amount of calories, fluids, carbohydrates, protein, fat, vitamins, and minerals—supplements help them maintain these nutritional needs.</p><p>However, it’s important to remember that no supplements are a substitute for a solid dietary foundation.</p><h3>How do I choose the right supplements for me?</h3><p>The use of supplements (fitness, <a href=# rel=noopener>weight loss supplements</a>, or others) remains controversial, and when it comes to what you’re putting into your body, it’s always worth erring on the dies of caution.</p><p>Before starting any new supplements, speak to your healthcare provider or sports dietician about their suitability for you and ask the following questions:</p><ul><li aria-level=1>Do the claims made by the supplement make sense?</li><li aria-level=1>Is there scientific evidence available for the ingredients?</li><li aria-level=1>Is the supplement safe, legal, and free of banned substances?</li></ul><p><i>Check out more of our picks and deals </i><a href=#><i>here</i></a><i>!</i></p><p class=p1><span class=s1><i>Disclaimer: We do not review the claims made by the manufacturer, and on occasion manufacturers may alter their ingredient lists.
