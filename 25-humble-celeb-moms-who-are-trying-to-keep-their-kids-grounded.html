The time constraints of having a successful career easily conflict with the demanding needs of taking care of a family.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kids of famous parents are a paparazzi goldmine. Wherever they go, they are being photographed starting from the day of their birth. Some photos of superstar infants, when they are first born, are worth up to hundreds of thousands of dollars for the tabloid press. Paparazzi photographers will do almost anything to get these photos.</p><p>When the kids go out in public with their famous parents, the attention continues. Moreover, if the famous parents are wealthy, they will have the financial resources to spoil their kids terribly.</p><p>In spite of all of these pressures, some celebrity moms and their husbands do their best to keep their kids grounded and help them live as “normal” of a life as possible.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=angelina-jolie>Angelina Jolie</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Angelina Jolie</a> is a great mom. When she goes on trips to foreign countries in her role as a U.N. Goodwill Ambassador, she frequently invites her children to go with her. They go along because they want to go. Recently, she took her two daughters Zahara and Shiloh to visit a refugee camp in Jordan that has many thousands of Syrian refugees. Her daughters played with some of the children and got to see their living conditions firsthand.</p><p>Jolie champions women’s and girl’s rights and especially is involved in helping educational programs for children. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">International Business Times</a> says that she is concerned about the challenges that the younger generation faces in the age of social media. She does not let her six children be active on social media and limits their access to the Internet. Instead of relishing her time on the red carpet as a Hollywood superstar, her favorite things to do are to take her kids shopping at the mall and to go out for pizza. It is clear from the many photos captured by the paparazzi that her children adore her, especially when they do “normal” things together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jolie was recently named by the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">2018 YouGov survey</a> as the most respected female in the world for the third year in a row. This annual survey asked 35,000 people in 35 countries who they admire the most. Being a great mom is a big part of why she is so admired.</p><h2 id=jennifer-garner>Jennifer Garner</h2><p><a href=#>Jennifer Garner</a> has three children from her marriage to her now ex-husband <a href=#>Ben Affleck</a>. They are Samuel, Seraphina, and Violet. She lives with the kids on a farm near the Los Angeles area. Jennifer says her mother taught her about healthy eating and she does the same with her children. They raise most of the food that they eat, which includes plenty of fruits and vegetables.</p><p>When Jennifer was pregnant with her first daughter, she opened a jar of baby food and was disgusted by it. That is when she decided that making food for her kids to eat using fresh things was the way to go. None of that store-bought overly-processed baby food was going to be fed to her kids. She started an organic baby food company in 2017 called Once Upon a Farm because she is so passionate about children’s nutrition.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jennifer keeps her kids grounded by working in the garden with them, pulling weeds, and taking care of the plants. She says in California almost anything grows and she enjoys continuing to plant new things with her kids.</p><h2 id=molly-sims>Molly Sims</h2><p><a href=#>Molly Sims</a> has three children, with her husband <a href=#>Scott Stuber</a>, who are all five-years-old or under. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a> reported that in April 2017 her children were Grey Douglas, three months old, Scarlet May, two years old, and Brooks Alan, four years old.</p><p>None of the pregnancies were planned. Now, Molly has three kids that are quite a handful to raise because they are so young. Sims rose to fame by being the Sports Illustrated swimsuit model for the issues of 2001, 2002, 2003, and 2004. In the 2006 issue, she rocked the world by wearing a $30 million dollar bikini for the Sports Illustrated Annual Swimsuit Issue.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sims was in the television series Las Vegas and made guest appearances in many comedy movies. She is the Global Ambassador for Population Services International's Five & Alive program. This organization helps with health crises for children under the age of five. She is also an ambassador for Operation Smile that offers cleft pallet repair surgery for children all over the world.</p><h2 id=serena-williams>Serena Williams</h2><p>When <a href=#>Serena Williams</a> was a nine-year-old girl with braids, she never imagined her career as a global sports figure winning medals at the Olympics and thereafter many tennis championships.</p><p>Serena had her first baby at the age of 36. This was the culmination of her dreams as a little girl that predated her aspiring career as an athlete. Like most young girls, she loved dolls and dreamed of someday being a mother.</p><p>Even though she is delighted to have her baby, she still wants to win two more Grand Slams in order to go down into the history books as the record-holder of 25 Grand Slams to beat the record held by Australian tennis hero Margaret Court who won 24 Grand Slams. Serena currently holds the award of 23 Grand Slams.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Serena says that when her baby Olympia was born she overcame all of the anxiety about the biological clock running out and her time to have a healthy baby diminishing. Now, that her baby is here; she can continue her tennis career.</p><h2 id=ciara>Ciara</h2><p><a href=#>Ciara</a> is married to the quarterback for the Seattle Seahawks, <a href=#>Russell Wilson</a>. In 2015, she started dating Wilson after she broke up with Future. She had a son with Future that was born in 2014. Wilson got engaged to Ciara in 2016 and they were married in July of that year. In April 2017, they had a baby girl. So this means they have two children to bring up together. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Glamour</a> reports that the couple gave their baby girl a special name, Sienna Princess Wilson.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Does this mean that the parents plan to spoil their girl child like a princess? Probably so; however, they have been doing a pretty good job of keeping their children grounded in reality of what it is like to be a “normal” kid. On the other hand, when Ciara and Russell Wilson were married, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Glamour</a> reported that her son was wearing a Giorgio Armani suit that upstaged his mother’s Robert Cavalli wedding dress.</p><h2 id=mila-kunis>Mila Kunis</h2><p><a href=#>Mila Kunis</a> is happily married to <a href=#>Ashton Kutcher</a>. They have two children, Dimitri Portwood, who is one and a half years old, born on November 30, 2016, and Wyatt Isabelle, who is almost four years old, born during October 2014.</p><p>Mila and Ashton work very hard to keep the kids grounded. They do not lavish them with Christmas gifts. In fact, in <a href=#>one past Christmas, there were no gifts at all</a>. According to Australian news, the children will not inherit the majority of the Kunis/Kutcher estate that is estimated to be worth about $300 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>They will not lack for support; however, spoiling them will ruin them according to the opinions of their super-famous parents. In spite of this good parenting, Kunis told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">US magazine</a> her boy is a “sloth.” A sloth is a very slow-moving animal. A possible conclusion is that the parenting style of not spoiling kids does not exactly motivate them either. Kunis is comfortable being a <a href=#>stay-at-home mom</a> so she has plenty of time to work on this problem.</p><p>The moral of this parenting style is that the kids of the Kunis/Kutcher family can forget about going to their parents and asking for a new Ferrari on their 16th birthday. That is never going to happen. If they ever want to achieve anything in life; they need to get off their lazy asses and do something. That seems fair.</p><h2 id=janet-jackson>Janet Jackson</h2><p><a href=#>Janet Jackson</a> is a wonderful woman; however, she has experienced so many up and downs that the emotional roller-coaster of her life must be very exhausting. Being the sister of the most famous pop star in the world, her brother Michael Jackson, could not have been that easy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Her father, Joe Jackson, has been described by many as being an alleged tyrant. Nevertheless, her mom, known affectionately as “Mother Jackson,” has always been the rock-solid example of love for the <a href=#>Jackson Family</a>.</p><p>It seems that Janet takes more after her mother. She got<a href=#> married to a Saudi billionaire, named Wissam al Manna</a>, which would normally make any women’s’ dream come true. In truth, money does not buy everything. If your husband is a jerk that becomes very clear. The marriage ended in a divorce very quickly and this happened right after she had her first baby boy named Eiassa.</p><p>Eiassa is an interesting name that has a female version as “Eiasa” and a male version with two “s” letters as in Eiassa. The Arabic meaning in English is “God is Salvation.” The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daily Mail UK</a> reports that Janet, who is now slightly over 50+ years old, has her baby with her everywhere she goes. They are inseparable. That is one obvious way to be a good mother. Certainly, the baby is way too young to know his father was a billionaire and his mother is a mega pop music star.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=blac-chyna>Blac Chyna</h2><p><a href=#>Blac Chyna</a> had a baby daughter with <a href=#>Rob Kardashian</a>, who was born on November 10, 2016. They named their daughter Dream Kardashian. Right after the birth of the baby girl, the two started divorce proceedings. Rob Kardashian alleged that his wife was having extra-marital affairs as his reason for seeking a divorce.</p><p>Blac Chyna, along with her security detail and entourage spent the past Easter Sunday on April 21, 2018, visiting the Six Flags amusement park in Valencia, California. When a fan touched her child <a href=#>she went ballistic</a>. She tried to take an unoccupied baby stroller and hit the offender with it. Her security team stopped her from doing this. The situation quickly dissipated and no criminal charges where filed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Later, Blac Chyna tweeted that she did not support violence; however, if any person thinks that they have the ability to touch her child without permission, she will defend them with her full force as necessary. While her little daughter may not yet be old enough to understand the force of her mom’s protection of her; she will certainly be able to see the viral video of the event that will stay on YouTube forever.</p><h2 id=natalie-portman>Natalie Portman</h2><p><a href=#>Natalie Portman</a> has two children. Her son, Aleph, was born during June 2011. Her daughter, Amalia, was born on February 22, 2017. Natalie married her husband, <a href=#>Benjamin Millepied</a>, in a ceremony held in Big Sur, California on August 4, 2012. They fell in love when they were working on the film The Black Swam. Natalie was in the starring role and Benjamin was the choreographer for the film. After they got married, they moved to France.</p><p>The paparazzi occasionally get snapshots of her with her family such as those shown in the report by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daily Mail UK</a> when they arrived as a family to New York City for the holiday season in December 2017. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Growing Your Baby</a> reported that they were also photographed enjoying a family vacation in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil later in that same month.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Then, presumably, it was back to France, where life is simpler and more normal. Once they escape the paparazzi at the Paris international airport, they are free to go to their home in the French countryside and live a life like a regular rural family.</p><h2 id=pink>Pink</h2><p><a href=#>Pink</a> has two children who she adores. Her daughter is named Willow. She is six years old. Her son is named Jameson and he is just now one. The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daily Mail UK</a> reports that Pink is raising her children in a “gender-neutral” household. She decided to do this after her daughter Willow expressed the desire to marry an African woman. That is a very sophisticated concept for a six-year-old and a more sophisticated response from her mom to have a nurturing home environment, which allows such free expression by her children.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In response to her daughter’s expressed desire to marry an African woman, Pink asked her if she would be able to teach her how to make African food. Her daughter said yes and assured her mom that they would live with her until they could build their own house. Pink would be very happy with anybody that her daughter chooses to love and her daughter has her full support no matter how this love expresses itself.</p><h2 id=chrissy-teigen>Chrissy Teigen</h2><p><a href=#>Chrissy Teigen</a> had her first child with husband/singer <a href=#>John Legend</a>, on April 14, 2016. It was a girl that they named Luna Simone Stephens. She is currently expecting her second child, which will be a boy that has yet to be named. The parents intend to choose a name that is unisex because they do not like the gender inequalities that exist. The birth should occur sometime during June 2018.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kidspot</a> reported that Chrissy experienced a severe bout of postpartum depression after the birth of her first child. Her experience is a common one for many women. Her honest account of what she went through was very helpful for others. She recovered and<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Parents</a> reports that she is happy to raise children in times where they can be the source of positive change.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Her husband also supports raising their children in an environment that is free from gender stereotypes. <a href=#>Huffington Post</a> reports his support for this parenting style. The parents plan to make toys available that are presented in an environment that is free from gender limitations and then let the children decide what they wish to play with.</p><h2 id=alanis-morissette>Alanis Morissette</h2><p><a href=#>Alanis Morissette</a> had a son and a daughter with her husband Mario Treadway, who is the rapper known as “Souleye.” Her son, named Ever Imre, was born in December 2010. Her daughter, named Onyx Solace, was born in June 2016.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Metro UK</a> reported that Alanis went through a very serious bought of postpartum depression that started 14 months after her daughter was born. This type of depression is caused by biological and chemical imbalances plus hormonal effects in the mother’s body. It feels really terrible because having a new child is supposed to be a happy experience. This also makes the mother feel guilty, which only increases the feeling of despair. When the onset of depression is delayed, as was in her case, it makes it much more debilitating.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She said that she had to fight the depression because she wanted to be able to properly take care of her kids. The struggle was not easy. Luckily, she got proper treatment and recovered from it completely.</p><h2 id=megan-fox>Megan Fox</h2><p>For some parents “grounded” means allowing a space that is free for children to express themselves. <a href=#>Megan Fox</a> has three children with her husband <a href=#>Brian Austin Green</a>. They are Noah and Bodhi who are twins that are five years old. The other child is Journey who is about two years old. The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sun UK</a> reported that in December 2017, Megan was seen in public with her children. Her son Noah was wearing a dress that was in the style of the character Elsa from the Disney movie entitled Frozen.</p><p>The father hammered back at critics of this dress style for their son by saying that “He is five and he can wear whatever clothes he likes. Young age is a time for fun, not arbitrary restrictions.” Noah has also been seen in public, wearing a Snow White costume.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Megan says she was raised in a Pentecostal Christian home that was overly restrictive and this is why she rebelled against this style with her parenting. She allows her kids to wear whatever they want.</p><h2 id=katherine-heigl>Katherine Heigl</h2><p><a href=#>Katherine Heigl</a> is married to singer/songwriter Joshua Bishop. This creative, dynamic-duo enjoy having three children. One child is a biological one and two are adopted. They adopted their first daughter, named Nancy Leigh, in September 2009. Their second adopted daughter, Adalaide Marie Hope, became a part of the family in April 2012. For a beautiful present during the holiday season, their first biological child was Joshua Bishop. He arrived in December 2016.</p><p>While raising her family, Katherine Heigl became an Emmy award-winning actor for her performances in the smash-hit television series of Grey’s Anatomy. In an interview with Parent & Child, which is a part of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Scholastic</a>, Heigl described her parenting style and her intense love for her family. She said, “Adoption is magnificent!”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The great news for all adopted kids out there is that even if your natural parents did not want you or could not take care of you when you select adopted parents to put your trust in them. They selected you because their love for you is exceptional. Adoptive children are loved not by force or by circumstance. They are loved by choice. This choice is a very powerful demonstration of love. Some might say being adopted is better because the parents and the children had the chance to choose each other.</p><p>Compassion is the driving force behind her parenting style and that has absolutely nothing to do with fame and fortune.</p><h2 id=reese-witherspoon>Reese Witherspoon</h2><p>Gorgeous <a href=#>Reese Witherspoon</a> is now 42 years old. The photo shows the resemblance between her mother and her daughter. She has three children, who are the results of two marriages. When she was younger, at the age of 23, she married <a href=#>Ryan Phillippe</a>. They met because they both were stars in the film Cruel Intentions. It is so easy to understand how Reese would fall in love with Ryan. They matched each other with outstanding physical beauty and sentiment.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Elle</a> reported that the two stayed married for seven lovely years and had two children together, a daughter Ava and a son Deacon. Reese says that her time with Ryan was wonderful. She does not regret anything about the relationship. Sometimes, adults feel compelled to move on. Mature adults handle this as best as they can.</p><p>When they do this well, the suffering of the children is lessened. In fact, children that learn that relationships can change and go through major adjustments are psychologically stronger if they find that later in their lives that they, unfortunately, may face a similar circumstance in their future.</p><p>After Reese and Ryan divorced, she remained congenial with her ex-husband. With her new husband, Jim Toth, she had a boy-child named Tennessee. Reese still has a tremendous love for all of her kids. She maintained this in spite of the dramatic life changes that she went through.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=olivia-wilde>Olivia Wilde</h2><p><a href=#>Olivia Wilde</a> has two children with her husband <a href=#>Jason Sudeikis</a>. The parents are both actors. They have a son, named Otis, who was born on April 20, 2014, and a daughter, named Daisy, who was born Oct. 11, 2016. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a> says that Olivia likes finding hope in the heart of her son Otis.</p><p>On the first birthday of Daisy, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a> reported that Olivia said. “My curious, courageous one, I promise we’ll work hard to make this place better for you...” The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daily Mail UK</a> said that Olivia likes to cuddle with her children when they go out in public. The kids are too young to know that their parents are famous; however, they do know that they are loved immensely.</p><p>Olivia feels that having her kids along with her is the most important thing. Both she and her husband do lots of movies. They try to be together as much as possible and most importantly to have the kids with them when they are working on a film set for many months.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=julia-roberts>Julia Roberts</h2><p><a href=#>Julia Roberts</a> has three children with her husband Danny Modern. They got married in 2002. Two of the children are fraternal twins, named Phinnaeus and Hazel, who are both 13 years old. The third child is Henry, who is ten years old.</p><p>The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daily Mail UK</a> says that one of the ways that Julia tries to keep her kids grounded is to take them out in public and try her best to remain incognito. This is not easy for Julia because she is so easily recognized.</p><p>Nevertheless, she wears toned-down clothes, sometimes with a big hat and dark sunglasses to try to look as much as possible like a normal “soccer” mom. When the paparazzi do catch photos of Julia with her kids; they all seem to show that they are having a really good time being out and about together.</p><p>Julia just likes to be their mom and leaves her superstardom aside when hanging out with her kids.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=eva-mendes>Eva Mendes</h2><p><a href=#>Eva Mendes</a> has two kids with her long-term steady boyfriend <a href=#>Ryan Gosling</a>.

With the help of her Cuban parents, she is raising her daughters to be bilingual in English and Spanish. She also exposes her daughters to Cuban culture by playing Cuban music and preparing traditional Cuban dishes of food.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Glamour</a> reports that Eva’s older daughter, at the age of about three, speaks a kind of Spanglish, which is really cute. Eva likes it when her parents take care of her children because since her dad only knows Spanish they are learning how to speak the Spanish language for him.</p><p>Eva is creating a plus-sized collection fashion line for New York & Co. so she is raising her daughters to be accepting of different body shapes and types, which is a very Cuban way to appreciate the female form in all of its different varieties.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jessica-biel>Jessica Biel</h2><p>Jessica Biel had one son with Justin Timberlake.

The, she returned to TV as the star and producer of the crime drama television show called The Sinner.</p><p>Besides Jessica’s career, she is worried that other women are constantly throwing themselves at her husband. This fear has put a strain on their relationship causing a <a href=#>separation during 2013</a>. The couple has been in relationship counseling to work out their problems. For now, Jessica has employed a nanny to help her raise her son, while she tries her best to figure out how to manage to be a mother with a very active professional career.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=gwen-stefani>Gwen Stefani</h2><p><a href=#>Gwen Stefani</a> has three children that are all boys. They are Kingston, who was born in May 2006, Zuma, who was born in August 2008, and Apollo, who was born in February 2014.

The couple loves going on family trips together and the boys have taken quite a liking to Blake. He took them all on many trips, especially to his home state of Oklahoma, where he introduced them to the fun of country style living, such as swimming in creeks and riding in the woods on ATVs.</p><p>They go fishing, trekking, and camping together on top of free-wheeling with the ATVs in the mud. Gwen, who used to be known for her outrageous performance style, has become a regular ole country wife.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=victoria-beckman>Victoria Beckman</h2><p>Victoria Beckman, who was already super famous for being in the <a href=#>Spice Girls</a>, named “Posh Spice,” fell in love with one of the greatest sportsmen of all time, David Beckman. We are happy to report the family is having a great time together. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">PopSugar</a> reported that they just celebrated David’s 43rd birthday together.</p><p>Victoria posted photos of him with his kids on Instagram that are so charming. The kids in the photo include the two sons, Cruz and Romeo, and their daughter, Harper. One of their children, the oldest son named Brooklyn, was in New York, so he could not be part of the festivities in London. He has grown up so fast. He is now 19 years old and living on his own in New York City, which is a great place to live if your name is Brooklyn.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Beckman children are so cute and they are showing robust talents in many different areas. This is incredible evidence of a “grounded” family that knows how to deal with the parents being so famous and be able to live a “normal” life at the same time. Kudos to Victoria for being able to create this wonderfully-balanced space for her family.</p><h2 id=zo-saldana>Zoë Saldana</h2><p>With her husband, Marco Perego, Zoë Saldana had twin boys, Bowie Ezio and Cy Aridio, who were born in November 2014. The two also had son Zen, who was born in February 2017. The couple has the two twin-toddlers who must be a bit a terror running all over the place and their infant son to take care of.</p><p>Zoë started her career as a dancer performing with the group Faces. She became more famous when she appeared on the popular television series Law & Order. She is incredibly beautiful and has an ever-growing group of fans that applaud her every move.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One thing that is true about almost all famous mothers, like Zoë, who is an outstanding actress, is that her kids see her as the “mom.” Telling a four-year-old that you are a famous actress and a tremendously-skilled dancer as the reason why he should eat his broccoli is certainly not going to help much to convince an unruly child.</p><h2 id=gisele-bundchen>Gisele Bundchen</h2><p>Supermodel <a href=#>Gisele Bundchen</a> is married to legendary football player <a href=#>Tom Brady</a> who is a sports superstar playing for the New England Patriots. Brady has a son, named John, from his former relationship with Bridget Moynahan, who is his ex-girlfriend. Gisele is a wonderful stepmother for John. Together with her husband Tom, they have two more children, named Benjamin and Vivian. The kids, now in 2018, are the ages of 10, eight, and five years old.</p><p>What is it like to have a supermodel as a mom and a major football player as a father? <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ET</a> reported that Tom was quoted as saying that his wife and kids “are getting the short end of the stick.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Giselle is very supportive of her husband’s career and she is a wonderful mom. Her main concern is not so much that Tom is missing “quality time” with his kids. She is worried about him being seriously injured while playing football, so she looks forward to the time when he can retire. Giselle is so loving, caring, and so beautiful inside and out.</p><h2 id=kelly-clarkson>Kelly Clarkson</h2><p>Who does not love <a href=#>Kelly Clarkson</a>? She was the winner on American Idol in the first season. She went on after that to build up an amazing career in spite of the barricades that blocked her.</p><p>Few know that when she first went out to Hollywood to try to “make it,” her apartment had a building fire that destroyed everything she had. There is a <a href=#>video of this event</a> on YouTube that chronicles what happened. This tragedy made her homeless. She had to return to Texas, her home state, to regroup. Most would probably have given up, not Kelly.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kelly is a very strong woman that is also very kind. She went through relationship troubles that put her up and down. Then, she met Brandon Blackstock. Brandon is a real winner. Together they had two babies, a little girl, named River Rose, and a boy, named Remington Alexander.</p><p>From outside appearances, their family is going ahead very nicely and Kelly will not need to sing her pop hit song, Since, You’ve Been Gone about Brandon.</p><h2 id=goldie-hawn>Goldie Hawn</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">PopSugar</a> reports that the romance between <a href=#>Kurt Russell</a> and <a href=#>Goldie Hawn</a> is a legendary success for Hollywood couples. They have been together for 35 years. They are not married!</p><p>The couple chose this unique partnering style because both of them thought that love would be more important than legal papers to keep them together. If either one could walk away, at any time, then; the only thing that would keep them together would be their love for each other. True love is a power that binds people together more than anything.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Goldie became famous for her appearances on the television show Laugh-In during the 1960s. She was an adorable “ditzy blonde” that said things that made her seem to have an innate intelligence that was unexpected. This routine was hilarious. Watch a video on <a href=#>YouTube</a> showing her explanation of why being dumb is better than being smart.</p><p>She is still adorable and full of life. This is why she is our number one choice for a famous mom that has kept her kids grounded. She loves her children so much it is obvious.</p><p>She has four kids. A long time ago, Kurt was married to Season Hubley and they had a son named Boston Russell. Also ages ago, Goldie was married to Bill Hudson and she had Oliver and <a href=#>Kate Hudson</a>. Kate is so striking in her beautiful resemblance to her mother. She has a fantastic career as an actor as well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Goldie and Kurt had one baby of their own in 1986 who they named Wyatt. Besides the children, who are now grownups, they have five grandchildren. Goldie is a really great mom and grandmother with a super terrific family and a wonderful life partner in Kurt Russell.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpaGWmsC1xcueqmhqZWK1trnBpZxmm5WhsqN5zKikrGWnnbxurdGeZK2qqZ67qHnTqGSknZWlerW0xKKpZqOZmcBus9GorKeclZl8</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f25-humble-celeb-moms-who-are-trying-to-keep-their-kids-grounded.html&text=25%20Humble%20Celeb%20Moms%20Who%20Are%20Trying%20To%20Keep%20Their%20Kids%20Grounded&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f25-humble-celeb-moms-who-are-trying-to-keep-their-kids-grounded.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f25-humble-celeb-moms-who-are-trying-to-keep-their-kids-grounded.html&title=25%20Humble%20Celeb%20Moms%20Who%20Are%20Trying%20To%20Keep%20Their%20Kids%20Grounded" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f25-humble-celeb-moms-who-are-trying-to-keep-their-kids-grounded.html&title=25%20Humble%20Celeb%20Moms%20Who%20Are%20Trying%20To%20Keep%20Their%20Kids%20Grounded" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f25-humble-celeb-moms-who-are-trying-to-keep-their-kids-grounded.html&title=25%20Humble%20Celeb%20Moms%20Who%20Are%20Trying%20To%20Keep%20Their%20Kids%20Grounded" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f25-humble-celeb-moms-who-are-trying-to-keep-their-kids-grounded.html&description=25%20Humble%20Celeb%20Moms%20Who%20Are%20Trying%20To%20Keep%20Their%20Kids%20Grounded" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./ashlelnok-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ashlelnok Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./who-was-matt-smith-before-he-became-daemon-targaryen.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Was Matt Smith Before He Became Daemon Targaryen?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
