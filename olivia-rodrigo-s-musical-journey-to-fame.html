She got her first break when she was cast in a commercial for Old Navy at the age of 12.</p><p>The following year, she made her debut on the Disney show titled Bizaardvark as a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">guitar player named Paige Olvera</a>. In 2019, Rodrigo further cemented her standing in the world of entertainment when she landed a big role as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nini Salazar-Roberts on </a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">High School Musical: The Series</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Kourtney Kardashian Throws Extravagant Disney Baby Shower At Her $9 Million Mansion</a></span></p><p>From there, she used her acting background and her popularity on Disney to advance her musical career. This was the same stepping stone used by stars like Miley Cyrus, Hillary Duff, and Selena Gomez. In 2020, she signed her first record label deal, and the following year, she released her life-changing single titled “Driver’s License."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=a-musical-journey-to-fame>A Musical Journey To Fame</h2><p>With numerous Grammy nominations at the tender age of 20, there’s no question as to why this rising icon is so popular and is touted as Gen Z’s “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Queen of Pop</a>.” As of 2021, Rodrigo’s popularity rose to new heights and stayed there.</p><p>The release of “Driver’s License” sent the internet into a mania that most would have never imagined. From a hint of nostalgia to unmistakable vocals, she was able to foster a much-needed connection with listeners during the first wave of the pandemic.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Her influence became even more apparent when she garnered two number one hits (which included “Driver’s License”), streams amassing in the billions, and a multitude of Grammy nominations. Throughout 2021, Rodrigo continued to score accolades – including TIME’s Entertainer of the Year and Billboard’s Woman of the Year.</p><p>She was also featured on the cover of nearly every pop culture magazine, cementing her status as an artist to watch.</p><h2 id=a-nod-from-taylor-swift>A Nod From Taylor Swift</h2><p>Rodrigo has described herself as one of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Taylor Swift’s biggest fans</a>. She covered some of Taylor Swift’s big hits – recordings which were welcomed by the “Shake It Off” singer, who praised her talents.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>This Is Taylor Swift's Net Worth, As Of 2023</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Her song “Deja Vu” was inspired by Swift’s track “Cruel Summer.” When Rodrigo earned her first number one, Swift congratulated her.</p><h2 id=why-ldquo-driver-rsquo-s-license-rdquo-is-so-popular>Why “Driver’s License” Is So Popular</h2><p>The breakout hit “Driver’s License” tells the story of a high school relationship that went south. With lyrics somewhat reminscent of Taylor Swift's, the song is much more than just someone lamenting the way in which their ex-partner moved on.</p><p>At its center, the song demonstrated an unmistakable quality that drew in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">listeners of all age groups</a> and backgrounds. According to Esquire.com, Rodrigo's “Driver’s License” was Gen Z's version of Swift's millennial anthem “You Belong to Me."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Amazon boasted that “Driver's License” was “the most requested song ever in one day on Alexa” – meanwhile, Apple indicated that the track “was the most-played song in the world" on Apple Music. Rodrigo said, “It's resonating with people because of how emotional it is, and I think everything else is not important.”</p><h2 id=musical-influences>Musical Influences</h2><p>Rodrigo’s musical career has been influenced by a number of artists, mainstream and independent. She’s clearly inspired by Taylor Swift – whom she has looked up to since she was 5 years old, and claims that she wouldn’t have grown into the songwriter she is today had she not been inspired by Swift.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another big inspiration for Rodrigo is indie pop star Gracie Abrams, who opened for her on the Sour Tour.</p><h2 id=setbacks-and-comebacks>Setbacks And Comebacks</h2><p>Rodrigo’s musical journey hasn’t been without <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">some setbacks</a> and contention. In some instances, she was even accused of plagiarism.</p><p>Social media users across Twitter and TikTok compared Rodrigo’s hit single “Good 4 U” to Paramore's song titled “Misery.” Eventually, the members of Paramore were issued a songwriting credit. When it comes to “Cruel Summer” by Taylor Swift, Rodrigo admitted that it influenced her “Deja Vu” single from Sour.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fortunately, the accusations against Rodrigo haven’t stopped the pop star from achieving success. She has many accolades under her belt – including the Billboard Artist 100 Chart, a Grammy Award for Best New Artist, an MTV Music Award for Song of the Year, a Billboard Music Award for Top New Artist, and a Juno Award for Best International Album of the Year.</p><h2 id=the-role-of-tiktok>The Role Of TikTok</h2><p>TikTok has become a major recruiting tool in the music industry, and the platform played a role in the success of “Driver’s License.” Rodrigo showcased the song on TikTok – where she spoke about obtaining her driver’s license in real life, the anguish blended with the experience, and the emotional upheaval involved.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans were encouraged by Rodrigo to revel in emotion and the moment, and they happily obliged. As of 2021, there were more than one million TikTok posts with the “Driver’s License” audio – and as of September 2023, the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube video for the song</a> racked up an astounding 474.3 million views.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmqKSZq7aiedGom6uhl6TAbrnUrKCcmZxit7DB0aecsmWkpHqnrcyeZg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2folivia-rodrigo-s-musical-journey-to-fame.html&text=Olivia%20Rodrigo%27s%20Musical%20Journey%20To%20Fame&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2folivia-rodrigo-s-musical-journey-to-fame.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2folivia-rodrigo-s-musical-journey-to-fame.html&title=Olivia%20Rodrigo%27s%20Musical%20Journey%20To%20Fame" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2folivia-rodrigo-s-musical-journey-to-fame.html&title=Olivia%20Rodrigo%27s%20Musical%20Journey%20To%20Fame" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2folivia-rodrigo-s-musical-journey-to-fame.html&title=Olivia%20Rodrigo%27s%20Musical%20Journey%20To%20Fame" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2folivia-rodrigo-s-musical-journey-to-fame.html&description=Olivia%20Rodrigo%27s%20Musical%20Journey%20To%20Fame" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./sarah-jade-dave-bautista-s-wife-biography-age-wiki-height-weight-boyfriend-family-more.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Sarah Jade (Dave Bautistas Wife) Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; More">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./jennifer-walcott-biography-age-wiki-height-weight-boyfriend-family-more.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jennifer Walcott Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; More">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
