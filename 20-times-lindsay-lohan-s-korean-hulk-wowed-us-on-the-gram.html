If she’s not partying up a storm in a European nightclub, she’s dating a hot new exotic guy and giving us major fomo on social media. But the thing is, a lot of her beaus don’t seem to last very long in our minds because we quickly forget about them once their relationship is over. Maybe they never really make much of an impression on us.</p><p>One guy who definitely has made an impression on us is Je-Yong Ha. Okay, so they may not be dating as a close source told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vanity Fair</a>: “Lol they are 100% not dating at all. They’re just friends." But the guy has been seen all over the place with Lindsay and has certainly made a lasting impression on us. I mean, have you seen him? He’s earned the title of the “Korean Hulk”. One look at him and you won’t wonder why.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ha is a South Korean billionaire who lives in Moscow, Russia and as with the rich and famous, loves posting his fabulous life for us all to see and live vicariously through him. Lindsay and Ha truly embody the term “lifestyles of the rich and famous” so much that we just had to put it all on one article for you to feast your eyes and enjoy (or be envious, whichever one applies). So now we bring you 20 Times Lindsay Lohan’s Korean hulk wowed us on the gram.</p><h2 id=jet-setting>20. Jet Setting</h2><p>There is no image that screams “I have money!” more than the image of a person in their own private jet. Ha knows this, which is why his gram is filled with endless pics of him in his jet. Unlike the rest of us, he doesn’t need to be squeezed into uncomfortable seats with very little leg room, he doesn’t need to be subjected to very dull airplane food and he certainly won’t have to deal with the uncomfortable cries of a baby or two on the plane. Nope. Mr. Ha, has too much money for that. He is traveling in style – upper-class style to be more specific.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He’s a billionaire with businesses in multiple countries. When it is required for him to attend those meetings in person, he needs to do so in style, unlike us mere peasants. Before you start hating and saying that he is trying too much, ask yourself this – If you were a billionaire who could afford a jet, would you keep that jet a secret?</p><p>What is interesting to me is how the jet is empty. In fact, all his jet pics are pretty much empty, which means he gets to enjoy it all by himself. Talk about life not being fair. Think about that the next time you board your Economy class&nbsp;flight.</p><h2 id=bugatti-riding>19. Bugatti Riding</h2><p>Since we touched on the fact that he owns a private jet, you know that he pretty much spends a lot of money in all other aspects of his travels. Don’t think that when he lands at an airport, he is catching a taxi like the rest of us. Oh no. If that is what you think then you are sadly mistaken. Ha does not do taxis people. Do you blame him though? Would you ride in a taxi that has been ridden by multiple people whom you don’t know when you can ride around town in your very own Bugatti?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ha seems to be living a Hip-Hop star’s music video in real life. A Bugatti on average costs around $2 million upwards (that’s just the base) and naturally, very few people can claim they own one. While the rest of us are driving our dear old hand-me-downs, taking bus rides or getting around in our trusted Toyotas, Ha joins the elite with cruising around in this very beautiful and sleek number. Some other celebrities with Bugattis are Tom Cruise, Chris Brown, Jay Z and Ralph Lauren, to name a few. It is truly a mark of having money and I guess when you have it, why not spend it?</p><h2 id=money-on-his-wrists>18. Money On His Wrists</h2><p>I think I found this to probably be one of the most hilarious entries on the list. I found it hilarious because I mean…Who on earth wears two watches at the same time? No matter how good looking or classy the watches are. People don’t do that. Maybe Hulk man gets confused about what time it is so he needs reassurance from the second watch. Or maybe all the traveling and jet-setting to various meetings has him worried about whether or not he’ll arrive at his various meetings on time. I don’t know people. All I know is that this pic looks a little like he needs to calm down. I mean, we get it – You have money.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Now relax and wear one watch like the rest of us…Oh, but how can I say that? Especially when he is NOT like the rest of us. In this pic, Ha poses with a Hublot watch and if you think this will dent your pocket by at least ten thousand dollars then you are absolutely correct. Imagine wearing something that’s worth ten thousand dollars on your wrist? Now imagine having that on both your wrists. Lifestyles of the rich and famous people. That’s all I’m saying.</p><h2 id=chilling-with-hollywood-star>17. Chilling With Hollywood Star</h2><p>Speaking of “lifestyles of the rich and famous”…For you to actually live that fabulous life, you know you have to hang out with Hollywood A-listers (or at least kid stars who were once at the top of their game but ended up getting a bad reputation and are now stuck with mediocre roles).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>We first got a glimpse of Lindsay and her Korean Hulk back in December 2017. They were spotted everywhere together that we obviously started speculating that something was going on between the two. As I’ve covered above, the two aren’t dating (well, they at least claim so. I’m not so sure how much I can trust them when they say they are not dating because I mean, how many times have these celebrities lied to us? Remember when Beyonce was adamant that Jay Z was just “a really good friend” of hers? Yeah, we all know how that turned out.)</p><p>So until they confirm it or some amazing paparazzi manage to sneak a pic of them smooching, all we can say right now is that the two are really good BFFs who like to hang out together. Ha has posted so many pics of Lohan and two always seem like they have a good time together.</p><h2 id=his-big-buddy>16. His Big Buddy</h2><p>Many people might gasp in shock at this pic. I mean, that’s a pretty big dog and I understand the initial shock but when I first saw this pic, I honestly didn’t even flinch. Hulk looks like he could own this dog. What I mean is – It just looks right. Could you imagine him with a Chihuahua? That would just not make any sense. And then there’s also that old saying about how owners resemble their dogs…or is it the other way around?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Either way, Ha and his dog definitely belong together and sometimes his dog gets more likes and retweets then when he is alone in a pic. The dog is popular in Moscow and is also a dog-show world champion. If he doesn’t watch out, his dog just might overshadow him.</p><p>The big dog is a Caucasian Ovcharka and he has named it Taeja. This big boy (I mean the dog) has been in many TV shows. Ha told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">GQ </a>that the dog is actually slightly heavier than him. “His height is 1m,20cm and his weight is 130kg. He’s heavier than I am. He eats more protein than I do. He eats 9 chickens every day”.</p><h2 id=looking-like-the-hulk>15. Looking Like The Hulk</h2><p>There’s a reason why he has been nicknamed the Korean Hulk. The man looks like it the people. You don’t have to wonder if he regularly works out because it’s very clear. Regarding his diet, it seems that he is not particularly too strict, but it does seem that he tries to get in as much protein in as possible.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In his interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">GQ</a>, he revealed that he eats quite a bit (Because that’s not obvious). “I don’t have a set amount of protein I eat per day. I just try to eat as much as I can. I’m not someone who’s trying to diet to make my body look pretty. I like big beefy, and strong bodies. That’s why I eat a lot. I eat a lot of pizza, hamburgers, and noodles”.</p><p>For any guys (or bodybuilding ladies) who are reading this and are a little jealous that you don’t look like this when you go on a junk food diet, he does add that although he eats his junk food, he also manages to balance his diet with natural and much healthier foods. He has to eat healthy to a certain extent to look this way…or amp up on those steroids – One of the two.</p><h2 id=how-he-gets-around>14. How He Gets Around</h2><p>Okay, so I’m putting another pic of his jet not to rub salt into our empty-wallet wounds. I’m putting another pic of his private jet because people, whether you’ll admit it to yourselves or not, it’s a pretty big deal to fly in your own private jet. Very few of our favorite celebrities can afford a private jet (Yes, not even Lindsay) so yeah, having one is kind of symbolic within the rich community.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It’s kind of like a “rich stamp”. Another thing about it is that he regularly posts pics of him flying around from city to city in his jet. That means that this could probably just be another Monday to him, people. Imagine having that kind of a life.</p><p>Besides the fact that he is Lindsay’s new BFF for now (because let’s face it, they never last. BFF or Boyfriend), Ha is well known in South Korea, Moscow and Dubai because of his bodybuilding and businesses. “I do business in Moscow, Russia, and Dubai”. His private jet definitely must be putting in some miles because he actually met our dear Lindsay in Mykonos, Greece. The man clearly gets around and we now know from him gram, that he does so in so much style.</p><h2 id=yolo>13. YOLO</h2><p>This is probably one of the favorite acronyms by&nbsp;millenials – You Only Live Once (YOLO). Yolo stems from the idea that life is short and you need to enjoy it every day before it’s too late.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Well, it seems that Ha is definitely a believer of the Yolo movement. Besides being seen in the world’s best clubs, riding around in the best cars, flying in the best jets, being seen with the biggest celebrities (or not the biggest celebrity right now but once was. Do you think he knows that in Hollywood Lindsay is really not that big of a deal anymore?) When Ha decides to bungee, he needs to do it big. I mean, he is the “Hulk”. This is why Ha decided to go to the world’s highest bungee jumping site.</p><p>The height is 233m, and the site is the Macau Tower in Macau, China. The tower was built by New Zealand entrepreneur Alan John Hacket and the site earned him a Guinness World Record as the highest commercial bungee jump in 2007. Do you know the saying “Go Big Or Go Home”? Yeah, when you want to show how bold you really are, this is where you go to and I guess Ha wanted to show us all that he is quite brave by taking this plunge. Well, good for him. I, on the other hand, like my feet placed firmly on the ground…and that’s how it’s going to stay.</p><h2 id=chilling-while-making-millions>12. Chilling While Making Millions</h2><p>This is obviously another example of “lifestyles of the rich and famous” living their lives and enjoying all that money of theirs. If you didn’t know him and just went by his social media accounts, you would think that all the guy does is lounge around all day before it is time to get to the gym for a few hours.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It isn’t really clear how he got his billions (some reports speculate that it is from inheritance, while other reporters claim that he’s earned every one of his billions through hard word). Whatever the case may be as to how he’s managed to get all his riches, one thing’s for sure – He is definitely living it up. He clearly loves the good life (Who doesn’t really) and seems that he does a whole lot more than just work out and enjoy different cuisines everywhere he goes.</p><p>Ha told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">GQ</a> that he does a lot in his spare time. “I go to art galleries a lot, and I participate in art auctions as well. I also like jewelry and watches, so I enjoy collecting limited-edition and exclusive models. I have also recently developed an interest in acting. I heard that Marvel is looking for a Korean hero. I really want to be that Korean hero and act on the big screen”. Could this be the reason why he is now all of a sudden Lindsay’s BFF?</p><h2 id=let-them-eat-cake>11. Let Them Eat Cake</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This is a famous&nbsp;quote that Marie-Antoinette, who lived in opulence while the French were starving, said to her people. Ha, on the other hand, seems to also seriously love his cake.</p><p>We are almost halfway through the list and I’m sure you’ve noticed by now how over the top the Korean Hulk can get. He seems to not do anything like a regular person. While many of us would go to a restaurant and then order a perfectly good and lovely dessert afterward, Ha has to one-up us. I mean, he can’t be seen as “regular” after all. Oh no. He is not going to have that.</p><p>When Ha feels like having a really good cake, he orders a golden cake. I kid you not people. I had to google this to verify it from different sources – There is actually a cake that people eat that is sprinkled with gold. This is NOT photoshopped. When Ha was on one of his many Dubai trips, he decided to order a golden sponge cake that is, as you can see in the pic, wrapped in gold.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Now, I don’t know about you, but I’m a dessert lover and when I saw this, I definitely wondered how it tastes like. I was, therefore, a little disappointed when I found out that the gold doesn’t affect the taste of the cake. Then why put it on the cake in the first place?&nbsp; Only goodness knows people. Only goodness knows.</p><h2 id=10-obsession-with-gold>10 Obsession With Gold</h2><p>This one on the list comes perfectly after the golden cake (which doesn’t taste any more special than the cake we eat by the way). Since he eats golden cake, the man surely must love gold…right? Well, yes. You are correct. Just one look at his social media and you will know that he may perhaps have an obsession with gold.</p><p>Lucky for him, he has all the money to feed this expensive obsession of his. Ha can regularly be seen with golden watches (sometimes a couple at a time), bracelets, chains…The list goes on. He clearly loves himself some gold. Just look at the pic – the man has a golden clock on the wall. Now I’m not sure if it’s wrapped in the same gold that was in that golden cake of his that doesn’t taste any special, but I do know that the man definitely does not hold back when it comes to spending money. And what better way to show how much money you have than look like you are straight out of a Hip Hop music video? While this is definitely crossing the “that’s a little too much” line, we’ll just have to take it because this is a list of how he is constantly wowing us on the gram after all.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=living-large>9. Living Large</h2><p>The man has a private jet, a Bugatti, numerous expensive watches, and eats golden cake in Dubai. He also travels from expensive city to expensive city, living life large and being unapologetic about it. By now, you know that it is highly unlikely that he will be living just down the street in our neighborhood.</p><p>I mean, we have perfectly normal lounges and bathrooms and kitchens and bedrooms, and parks for the kids and dogs to play. We stay in cute neighborhoods that are perfectly fine and there is nothing to be ashamed of but remember people – this man does not do anything normal or “cute”. He goes big (Not just with his biceps).</p><p>When he is not first class traveling in his private jet or cruising around in his Bugatti, Ha enjoys lounging around at his expensive apartment in Moscow. The very large lounge overlooks the city and all its people. I wonder if he sometimes has a moment to look at the view and appreciate all he has, compared to others or if he just stands up there and laughs out loud at the rest of us below. If only we could tap into that big head of his for a minute to find out.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=stepping-out-on-expensive-soles>8. Stepping Out On Expensive Soles</h2><p>This one on the list should come at no surprise. Many people love themselves a good pair of sneakers. They are comfortable and always the best choice when you’re out and about and not in the mood to be sore from your high heels.</p><p>Many good sneakers can be quite costly but hey, a lot of people purchase them anyway because not only are they super comfortable, they also look good with an array of outfits. You can pop a jean on, some yoga pants, a cute skirt, some tracksuit pants…sneakers go with almost anything, which is probably the reason why they receive so much love from people.</p><p>Now, I don’t know about you but this Louis Vuitton pair seems a bit too much. I mean, what on earth would you wear that with? I believe that fashion should be sensible. You can spend all the money you want on shoes or a top or a pair of jeans but you have to ask yourself how that’s going to make sense when you step out with it. It’s clear that when Ha buys sneakers, he chooses based on what the most expensive pair is and which pair will get him the most attention.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=taking-it-easy>7. Taking It Easy</h2><p>I’ve already covered how Ha loves to travel not only for his businesses but also for leisure. This is a pic that probably depicts how he sees himself – He on top, overlooking us mere peasants on the bottom. This pic was taken while he was vacationing in Greece. He regularly visits Mykonos, Greece and we have already covered that is where he met our dear Lindsay.</p><p>Before you think that he will probably go bankrupt soon because of his spending habits, think again. This man is not only living large but he also has big business plans. “I have interest in the entertainment business, so I’m preparing to open nightclubs in many different countries. I am planning to open a Lohan Club in Dubai. In Moscow, I plan to make the most luxurious and expensive restaurant in the world.”</p><p>Big plans – which I’m sure will all come to fruition since he already has the money to start all of these. Did you also notice the “Lohan Club” plan in Dubai? Is our Lindsay going to be a co-owner? If this is why they’ve been hanging out a lot, we’re happy for her. She needs to start thinking outside of Hollywood because that ship has sailed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=flashing-riches>6. Flashing Riches</h2><p>Anyone who just spends 5 minutes googling the Korean Hulk will see that the man definitely lives a lavish life. He certainly is spending all those billions he has in his bank account and no one is stopping him anytime soon. Ha loves to flash his riches.</p><p>In this pic, we see him posing right in the middle of the passageway of his mansion… Yes, you read right – He has a mansion. Did you think a private jet-setting, Bugatti driving, gold cake eating man such as this lives in anything less than a mansion? Oh, come on. That would absolutely make no sense.</p><p>So I have already covered how he has an apartment in Moscow, well, the big man has also invested in a large mansion. Just like everything else in his life, we all have front row seats to feast our eyes and wallow in the richness of it all. Ha regularly posts pics of him in his mansion and with this one, he is right in the middle of his hallway dressed head to toe in expensive brands. Something tells me that this Korean Hulk definitely does not mind having all eyes on him.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=arm-wrestling>5. Arm Wrestling</h2><p>Ha loves to arm wrestle. Well, we’ve seen his biceps. Anyone with those big boys on his arms needs to put them to good use, right? I’ve already covered the fact that he eats a lot (which should come as no surprise. I mean, look at the guy. A large chunk of his money probably goes to feeding him and his dog).</p><p>Well, all this food in his body would naturally just turn to fat if he doesn’t spend a lot of time at the gym. The Korean Hulk, of course, doesn’t want to be fat. I mean, yes, The Hulk is big and all but that’s because of muscle, not fat. So naturally, the man spends a lot of his time at the gym in order to maintain his muscles and also to build on them (like he needs bigger muscles).</p><p>If you’re a fitness fanatic and want to pump up those muscles of yours, read up on what he gets up to at the gym. “I go to the gym every day. I exercise in 5-minute intervals. I repeat sets that exercise my chest, back, shoulders, arms, and legs. I try my best to eat as much as I can, and lift as heavy as I can.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=selfies-with-lindsay>4. Selfies With Lindsay</h2><p>Lohan and Ha really look like they have themselves a good time. Ha has revealed that they are very close and contact each other a lot. He has also described her as an “angel”. Uhm, okay.</p><p>The two hit it off just a few months ago in Greece and we now know that perhaps the reason behind all of this social media posting is because Ha has big plans for Lindsay – he wants to open a club named after her in Dubai.</p><p>To hang out with the rich and famous, one, of course, has to dress just like them. Well, Ha got that memo and judging by all the brands he normally posts, we know he loves to show us all that he wears only the best brands. “I like a brand called Billionaire Couture. I also like Versace these days. Brands are important, but since I like bespoke suits, I think that the fabric, design, and how well it suits my body is more important.”</p><p>I don’t know about you, but I’m still hung up on the “Billionaire Couture”. So there is an actual brand that caters to the elite?</p><h2 id=champion>3. Champion</h2><p>I’ve covered a lot about how rich Ha is since, well, that’s what he mostly posts about. But did you know that he is actually a professional powerlifter? He revealed this in his GQ interview: “I competed at many open categories for powerlifting in which I was named national champion for bench press (270kg), deadlift (340kg), and squat (320kg), which are all national records.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This is how he earned his nickname. “That’s why many people call me the ‘all time no. 1 strength in Korea’ or the ‘koreanhulk’. Especially for benchpress, my record is extremely close to the world record, in which I am working toward breaking the world record in the near future.”</p><p>I don’t know about you but this is probably the first time on the list I felt like I could relate to the man. Of course, I’m not bench pressing 270kg (or anything else for that matter), but I can relate to how hard the man seems to be working in order to achieve his goals. He should show us this side of him more often. Yes, the LV shoes and the fancy mansions are great to drool over but seeing that he is working hard at achieving his goals makes us say – He is one of us (Just this one time only)</p><h2 id=the-fur-coat-obsession>2. The Fur Coat Obsession</h2><p>The man owns over 50 fur coats. Yep, you read right. 50! This one on the list I’m not so crazy about because, you know, the animals situation. Yeah, someone should tell him about that.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He regularly posts his fur coats. Since I’m talking about his dress sense, can you imagine how difficult it must be for him to find clothing that fits? Surely The Hulk can’t be finding his tops and pants from the same stores we find them. What on earth does he do to make sure that he is always dressed in clothing that fits him so well?</p><p>“It’s very hard. I’m short, my body is big, and my arms are too big, so it’s hard for me to find clothes that fit me. I like wearing suits, so I have a personal tailor. I want to show people that even if you’re short with a big body, you can wear clothes that make you feel good.”</p><p>Ah, of course, he has a personal tailor! Wouldn’t have expected anything less. Well, for what it’s worth, although I’m not crazy about a lot of his fashion choices (most of it actually. He just tries too much), I can say that the man does wear clothing that fits him perfectly.</p><h2 id=he-has-the-best-rides>1. He Has the Best Rides</h2><p>This is number 1 on the list and I want you to take a moment to just have a look at the pic. Look at all that leather. Look at that recliner in a vehicle. Look at those sunglasses and watch. Look at the gadgets that he has all around him…Basically, look at all that money ladies and gentlemen.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Summed up in one pic, this is how Lindsay Lohan’s Korean Hulk wows us every day on the gram. This is what he keeps posting for all his lovers and haters to see. This is how he reminds us all that we are living worlds apart and I’m not just talking about geographically – I am talking about bank accounts here. I don’t know about you, but this pic alone tells me that there’s a huge difference between his bank account and mine. I have never looked this comfortable in the backseat of any car.</p><p>Since he already has a Bugatti, what other rides could he possibly want to show off that will top that? Well, a limo that is properly pimped out of course. Just like his private jet pic earlier was screaming “I have money!” this one is screaming even much louder “Lots of it!”</p><p>References: Vanity Fair, GQ</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpaGWmsC1xcueqmhqYGLBqrnErGSloZ6ZwKLFjKWmoZmeqHqsu9GemKdlmKq5rHnWqK6enF2qwG67zWaqqJuZlrluucSdoJpn</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f20-times-lindsay-lohan-s-korean-hulk-wowed-us-on-the-gram.html&text=20%20Times%20Lindsay%20Lohan%27s%20Korean%20Hulk%20Wowed%20Us%20On%20The%20Gram&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f20-times-lindsay-lohan-s-korean-hulk-wowed-us-on-the-gram.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f20-times-lindsay-lohan-s-korean-hulk-wowed-us-on-the-gram.html&title=20%20Times%20Lindsay%20Lohan%27s%20Korean%20Hulk%20Wowed%20Us%20On%20The%20Gram" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f20-times-lindsay-lohan-s-korean-hulk-wowed-us-on-the-gram.html&title=20%20Times%20Lindsay%20Lohan%27s%20Korean%20Hulk%20Wowed%20Us%20On%20The%20Gram" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f20-times-lindsay-lohan-s-korean-hulk-wowed-us-on-the-gram.html&title=20%20Times%20Lindsay%20Lohan%27s%20Korean%20Hulk%20Wowed%20Us%20On%20The%20Gram" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f20-times-lindsay-lohan-s-korean-hulk-wowed-us-on-the-gram.html&description=20%20Times%20Lindsay%20Lohan%27s%20Korean%20Hulk%20Wowed%20Us%20On%20The%20Gram" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./big-brother-s-paul-abrahamian-the-cast-voted-to-see-me-lose.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Big Brothers Paul Abrahamian: The Cast 'Voted to See Me Lose'">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./roblox-founder-s-wealth-soars-to-4-2-billion-here-s-why.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="'Roblox' Founder's Wealth Soars To $4.2 Billion, Here's Why">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
