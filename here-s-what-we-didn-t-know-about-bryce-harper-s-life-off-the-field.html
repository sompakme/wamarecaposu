Harper is not only well known around the MLB but is known quite well around the wide world of sports as a whole for his play on the field. It doesn't matter if it's for good or bad, Harper always has the spotlight on him. Whether you think he's overrated like much of Twitter, it's difficult to ignore his career accolades to date. Awards like the 2012&nbsp;National League (NL) Rookie of the Year and unanimous NL MVP in 2015 to name a couple. It also helps in becoming a global sports personality when you're on the cover of&nbsp;Sports Illustrated&nbsp;at just 16-years-old effectively drawing Lebron James comparisons. The SI cover and the label "Chosen One" will do that to anyone.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But what is Harper like off the field and more so away from the game of baseball? Here are 14 things about his life when he isn't on the diamond.</p><h2 id=married-his-high-school-sweetheart-at-23-years-old><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Married His High School Sweetheart At 23-Years-Old</span></h2><p>After a failed engagement in 2015, Harper reunited with his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">highschool sweetheart Kayla Varner</a> a few months later and the two officially got <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">married</a> in 2016. The two credit their religious beliefs as to be one of if not the most important part of their marriage.</p><h2 id=dropped-out-of-high-school-after-grade-10><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Dropped Out Of High School After Grade 10</span></h2><p>By the time Harper was in grade 10,&nbsp;he was long past the world of education because of his baseball talent. By the end of the 10th grade, Harper was able to obtain his GED making him <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">eligible for the MLB Draft</a> where he would go first overall to the Washington Nationals.</p><h2 id=huge-dog-person><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Huge Dog Person</span></h2><p>Harper has been known around the league and by his friends and family for his love of dogs, like most of us. His most recent addition to the family is named Wrigley (not pictured above). The name choice sparked all of the Harper to the Cubs rumors you could think of.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=regular-church-goer-as-a-mormon><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Regular Church Goer As A Mormon</span></h2><p>As mentioned, both Harper's are deeply rooted in the Mormon religion. Bryce takes his role as a Mormon very seriously evidently with his no alcohol rule. He's admitted to sometimes having the odd cup of coffee during games, but we won't tell.</p><h2 id=he-doesn-t-drink-at-all><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>He Doesn't Drink (At All)</span></h2><p>Who is does this guy think he is the Tom Brady of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">baseball</a>? All kidding aside, Harper is completely dry. This might make his stake in the ownership of a national bar kind of ironic, but any business is good business. Gotta give him credit for the dedication in taking care of his body too.</p><h2 id=he-is-a-car-enthusiast><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>He Is A Car Enthusiast</span></h2><p>If you're making the money Harper is making now with the Phillies, it's acceptable to collect something expensive like classic <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">cars</a>. Harper does enjoy a nice set of wheels like his&nbsp;custom 1969 Chevy Camero he had personally built for him one off-season.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">18 Athletes Who Have Ridiculously Old Cars</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=great-friends-with-kris-bryant><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Great Friends With Kris Bryant</span></h2><p>The bromance between these two stems from their childhoods spent together in Nevada. The two have stayed tight since and even their wives have become good friends. Harper and Bryant have either played against each other or on the same team since they were eight-years-old.</p><h2 id=his-harper-s-heros-program-for-leukemia-amp-lymphoma><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>His "Harper's Heros" Program For&nbsp; Leukemia & Lymphoma</span></h2><p>Where Harper may be one of the more firey players on the field, he has a heart of gold off of it. He partnered with The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society back in 2013 when he launched his "Harpers Heros" program. The program is devoted to helping kids fight against&nbsp;blood cancers</p><h2 id=used-to-be-a-catcher><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Used To Be A Catcher</span></h2><p>Though he has played the outfield for his entire MLB career thus far, Harper was actually&nbsp;a catcher for pretty much all of his career prior to the MLB. The Nationals drafted him as an outfielder in an effort to extend the duration of his career and get him to the MLB sooner.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=not-universally-loved-around-the-mlb><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Not Universally Loved Around The MLB</span></h2><p>As Harper is spoken of highly by his friends, family, and teammates, the same can't always be said around the MLB. His <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">fiery style</a> of playing the game and willingness to speak his mind to umpires has gotten him into the bad books of some around the league.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 MLB Players Fans Adore (And 8 Who Have A Bad Reputation)</a></span></p><h2 id=net-worth-around-70-million><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Net Worth Around $70 Million</span></h2><p>After signing his&nbsp;$330 million, 13-year contract with the Philadelphia Phillies, his net worth is currently sitting around $70 million. That works out to $63, 000 per at-bat. Pretty impressive for being just 27-years-old and only having eight MLB seasons under his belt.</p><h2 id=he-s-a-gym-rat><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>He's A Gym Rat</span></h2><p>Natural ability in a sport is one thing, but pairing that with a good strength and conditioning program is usually the key to becoming great. Harper doesn't take this notion lightly as he is in the gym trying to get better almost daily; even while in quarantine (pictured above).</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Joe Rogan Workout Photos That’ll Make You Want To Hit The Gym</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=his-older-brother-bryan-was-also-a-highly-touted-prospect><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>His Older Brother Bryan Was Also A Highly Touted Prospect</span></h2><p>The older of the Harper brothers, Bryan, now a former MLB pitcher, spent eight seasons himself as a pitcher in the Nationals organization. Unlike Bryce, Bryan went out east to school at the University of South Carolina where he worked on his craft.</p><h2 id=spokesperson-for-blind-barber-hair-and-beard-products><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Spokesperson For Blind Barber&nbsp;Hair And Beard Products</span></h2><p>It's difficult not to notice Harper's luscious, flowing locks on his head and face. His grooming habits ultimately lead to him becoming the spokesperson for&nbsp;Blind Barber. Naturally, Bryce has since come out with his own signature series of&nbsp;Blind Barber&nbsp;products.</p><p>Sources:&nbsp;Philadelphia Inquiry, YouTube, ESPN.com</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What Impact Will The Delay Have On The MLB Season?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHq4tMCtZLCdXZm2pbrTZqKnp6dirqO71K1km6qpmLJutMCrp56qo2K5qrLEZqafnl2ptaZ5xaKcpZxf</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fhere-s-what-we-didn-t-know-about-bryce-harper-s-life-off-the-field.html&text=Heres%20What%20We%20Didnt%20Know%20About%20Bryce%20Harpers%20Life%20Off%20The%20Field&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhere-s-what-we-didn-t-know-about-bryce-harper-s-life-off-the-field.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhere-s-what-we-didn-t-know-about-bryce-harper-s-life-off-the-field.html&title=Heres%20What%20We%20Didnt%20Know%20About%20Bryce%20Harpers%20Life%20Off%20The%20Field" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fhere-s-what-we-didn-t-know-about-bryce-harper-s-life-off-the-field.html&title=Heres%20What%20We%20Didnt%20Know%20About%20Bryce%20Harpers%20Life%20Off%20The%20Field" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fhere-s-what-we-didn-t-know-about-bryce-harper-s-life-off-the-field.html&title=Heres%20What%20We%20Didnt%20Know%20About%20Bryce%20Harpers%20Life%20Off%20The%20Field" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhere-s-what-we-didn-t-know-about-bryce-harper-s-life-off-the-field.html&description=Heres%20What%20We%20Didnt%20Know%20About%20Bryce%20Harpers%20Life%20Off%20The%20Field" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./is-amanda-yip-married-her-bio-age-husband-children-and-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Is Amanda Yip Married?
