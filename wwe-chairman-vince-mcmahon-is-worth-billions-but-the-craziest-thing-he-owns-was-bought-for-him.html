For example, Dwayne Johnson likes making action movies while looking huge, Beyoncé releases meaningful and beloved music, and Tom Cruise performs wild stunts.Unlike all the predictable celebrities, Vince McMahon has always kept the masses guessing. After all, he is the type of man who twice tried to launch a football league to compete with the NFL and who leaves fans wondering <a href=#>if he is a maniac or a mastermind</a>.On top of keeping observers on the edge of their seats when it comes to his business moves, McMahon also has a very complicated reputation when it comes to his personal life. After all, several <a href=#>shady facts about McMahon</a> have come to light, and it is known that <a href=#>some people who've worked for Vince love him while others can't stand him</a>.Given how unusual McMahon seems to be from all accounts, it shouldn't surprise anyone that the billionaire owns a lot of strange stuff. However, the thing that truly is shocking is that arguably the most incredible thing that McMahon owns was bought by someone else.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-is-the-most-incredible-thing-that-vince-mcmahon-owns>What Is The Most Incredible Thing That Vince McMahon Owns?</h2><p>In boardrooms all over the world, there are loads of business leaders who rake in so much that they are worth more money than some communities will make in years. In most cases, the masses have absolutely no idea who those business leaders are or what they do with their money.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Much Money Did Bad Bunny Make From His Work With The WWE?</a></span></p><p>Unlike his peers in the business world, Vince McMahon spent years boasting about how rich, famous, smart, and accomplished he is. Sure, a lot of the clips of McMahon bragging about things come from when he was in character as a fictional version of himself. However, McMahon also loved to boast when he is himself.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/vince-mcmahon-and-stephanie-mcmahon.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A perfect example of McMahon's attitude is the fact that the UFC's head honcho revealed in 2013 that Vince challenged him to a fight. In case people thought McMahon meant a bout in a WWE ring with a predetermined winner, White says <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vince was open to fighting him for real in a UFC octagon</a>.</p><p>"Let me tell you something, and I'll tell you this, I've never ever said this before ever in an interview anywhere, okay? If Vince hears this he's going to go nuts, okay? Vince it too old. He's too old, which he won't think he is and he'll go crazy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/vince-mcmahon.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"He wanted to do that one time. Vince wanted to fight me - swear to God. He called me up, said, ‘Let's do it. We can do it in the UFC, or let's do it at WrestleMania.'" White continued, "and I said, ‘You are crazy.' Vince is -- a lot of people talk about Vince. I've always said it and I'll say it again, I respect Vince very much. But Vince is too old to be fighting anybody."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Vince McMahon's 15 Biggest Mistakes, In Photos</a></span></p><p>Given the fact that McMahon is the kind of guy to challenge a fellow business leader to a fight when he was in his sixties, it likely won't surprise anyone that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vince buys crazy stuff with his fortune</a>.</p><p>Some of the wild stuff McMahon reportedly has bought for himself include supposedly real bear skin rugs, a massive portrait of himself, and the services of personal chefs. McMahon also reportedly owns a $40 million mansion, a yacht, a Florida vacation home, and private gyms.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In short, based on what is known about the things McMahon owns, it seems very clear that if he wants something, he gets it. With that in mind and his over-the-top personality, it certainly seems like McMahon should have been the one to buy himself the most interesting thing he owns. However, it turns out that his son-in-law, the wrestler Triple H did that.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/vince-mcmahon-shane-mcmahon-and-triple-h.jpg><p>In 2011, Triple H starred in a forgettable movie that WWE Studios released titled The Chaperone. When Triple H was working on that movie, they shot a scene in a museum. Evidently impressed by the fossils on display, Triple H decided that he needed to buy a dinosaur fossil for McMahon.</p><p>Ultimately, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Triple H bought McMahon a Tyrannosaurus skull fossil</a>. Obviously impressed with the incredible gift, McMahon had the fossil put up on the wall of his office in WWE's Stamford building.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, McMahon is a unique guy, so he didn't stop at exhibiting the fossil on his wall. Instead, McMahon tweeted out a photo of the fossil and wrote about how the skull symbolizes his appetite. On top of that, according to an article about the fossil that was published on WWE.com the fossil has been given the name Stan T. Rex.</p><h2 id=how-much-money-is-vince-mcmahon-worth>How Much Money Is Vince McMahon Worth?</h2><p>Back when Vince McMahon bought the company that is now known as the WWE from his father, there was a very good chance he was going to go broke. After all, according to the deal he made with his dad, if McMahon missed a single payment, ownership of the company would revert.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Vince McMahon: The Women He Is Close To And Keeps His Distance From</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>McMahon also could have lost it all when the WWE held the first WrestleMania since so much of his money was wrapped up in that event which could have flopped. Decades after both of those perilous moments, it now is very clear that unless something truly mind-blowing happens, McMahon will never have to worry about money again.</p><p>Thanks to McMahon's ability to make the WWE the business leader in the professional wrestling business and his choice to take the company public, he is incredibly rich. In fact, Forbes reports that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">McMahon has a $2.9 billion fortune</a> as of this writing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/vince-mcmahon-hulk-hogan-and-sylvester-stallone.jpg><p>As amazing as it is that McMahon has a fortune that can be measured in billions, there is a strong possibility he will become richer soon.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In recent months, McMahon has revealed that there are efforts to look at potential offers to buy the WWE in the coming months. If a deal like that winds up going through, McMahon will make a fortune since he owns thousands of WWE shares.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiusJ1dmLWitdGmmKdlpp67pLGMppqmmZiku266xK1ksKeiqbVuv8%2BepZ2hnpx6tb7EsWSfp6Ootq17</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwwe-chairman-vince-mcmahon-is-worth-billions-but-the-craziest-thing-he-owns-was-bought-for-him.html&text=WWE%20Chairman%20Vince%20McMahon%20Is%20Worth%20Billions%20But%20The%20Craziest%20Thing%20He%20Owns%20Was%20Bought%20For%20Him&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwwe-chairman-vince-mcmahon-is-worth-billions-but-the-craziest-thing-he-owns-was-bought-for-him.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwwe-chairman-vince-mcmahon-is-worth-billions-but-the-craziest-thing-he-owns-was-bought-for-him.html&title=WWE%20Chairman%20Vince%20McMahon%20Is%20Worth%20Billions%20But%20The%20Craziest%20Thing%20He%20Owns%20Was%20Bought%20For%20Him" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwwe-chairman-vince-mcmahon-is-worth-billions-but-the-craziest-thing-he-owns-was-bought-for-him.html&title=WWE%20Chairman%20Vince%20McMahon%20Is%20Worth%20Billions%20But%20The%20Craziest%20Thing%20He%20Owns%20Was%20Bought%20For%20Him" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwwe-chairman-vince-mcmahon-is-worth-billions-but-the-craziest-thing-he-owns-was-bought-for-him.html&title=WWE%20Chairman%20Vince%20McMahon%20Is%20Worth%20Billions%20But%20The%20Craziest%20Thing%20He%20Owns%20Was%20Bought%20For%20Him" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwwe-chairman-vince-mcmahon-is-worth-billions-but-the-craziest-thing-he-owns-was-bought-for-him.html&description=WWE%20Chairman%20Vince%20McMahon%20Is%20Worth%20Billions%20But%20The%20Craziest%20Thing%20He%20Owns%20Was%20Bought%20For%20Him" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./zack-bia-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Zack Bia Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./what-s-in-a-name-david-and-victoria-s-son-romeo-james.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What's in a Name?
