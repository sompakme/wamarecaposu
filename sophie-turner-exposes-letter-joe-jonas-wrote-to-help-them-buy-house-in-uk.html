She’s made a variety of accusations, including that she only learnt of his decision to divorce via the media, though Joe denies her claims.</p><p>Most recently, Sophie filed legal documents to support her case, which includes the letter Joe seemingly wrote to help convince a UK homeowner to sell to them.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/tr-dark.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Joe Jonas & Sophie Turner Make Millions Selling Miami Home A Year After Buying</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>The couple made a series of renovations only to sell the mansion a year into owning it.</span><p>"When my wife and I decided we were going to spend more time in the UK and search for a permanent home, our daughter expressed three unwavering requirements: having chickens, a pony and a Wendy house,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the former Disney star wrote in the alleged letter</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“While many of the houses we viewed met this criteria, the moment we turned the corner and caught sight of the charming blue shutters adorning [redacted], we experienced a sense of magic unlike anything we had felt before,” Joe continued.</p><p>Joe emphasized that he and Sophie planned to make their permanent residence in the UK after raising their daughters- currently 3 and 1-years old – in the U.S.</p><p>"We can envision our children growing up here and making this our forever home,” he continued. “I really think Sophie and I will be able to look after [our girls] and for many years pay homage to the magic you have created here.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ultimately, however, it appears the couple didn’t seal the deal on the house. "They did not buy the house. The house is in escrow, the sale never closed,” <a href=#>a source told PEOPLE</a>. Sophie’s court filing reveals that they apparently began house hunting in her native UK in December 2022, before entering a contract to buy the house in July, which was supposed to be completed by December.</p><p>But it looks unlikely that the deal will ever go through, considering the pair are divorcing and Joe seems to want to remain in the US.</p><p>Though Joe hasn’t responded to the letter being made public, he did <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">deny Sophie’s earlier claims via a statement</a> from his representative, who said it would violate Florida law to handover the passports and take their daughters abroad, since the divorce has been filed in the American state.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmrKegnbamedOuqaedomKyubzOrJysZZyawbWx0WahqJ1dn7yvrdJmrqunpJp6o8HYZp%2BoraOaera3jg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fsophie-turner-exposes-letter-joe-jonas-wrote-to-help-them-buy-house-in-uk.html&text=Sophie%20Turner%20Exposes%20Letter%20Joe%20Jonas%20Wrote%20To%20Help%20Them%20Buy%20House%20In%20UK&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsophie-turner-exposes-letter-joe-jonas-wrote-to-help-them-buy-house-in-uk.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsophie-turner-exposes-letter-joe-jonas-wrote-to-help-them-buy-house-in-uk.html&title=Sophie%20Turner%20Exposes%20Letter%20Joe%20Jonas%20Wrote%20To%20Help%20Them%20Buy%20House%20In%20UK" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fsophie-turner-exposes-letter-joe-jonas-wrote-to-help-them-buy-house-in-uk.html&title=Sophie%20Turner%20Exposes%20Letter%20Joe%20Jonas%20Wrote%20To%20Help%20Them%20Buy%20House%20In%20UK" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fsophie-turner-exposes-letter-joe-jonas-wrote-to-help-them-buy-house-in-uk.html&title=Sophie%20Turner%20Exposes%20Letter%20Joe%20Jonas%20Wrote%20To%20Help%20Them%20Buy%20House%20In%20UK" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsophie-turner-exposes-letter-joe-jonas-wrote-to-help-them-buy-house-in-uk.html&description=Sophie%20Turner%20Exposes%20Letter%20Joe%20Jonas%20Wrote%20To%20Help%20Them%20Buy%20House%20In%20UK" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./tom-trybull-stats-23-24.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tom Trybull - Stats 23/24">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./riverdale-news-us-weekly.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Riverdale News - Us Weekly">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
