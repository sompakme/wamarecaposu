Murdaugh faces 30 years to life in prison without parole for each murder charge.</p><p><strong>“The evidence of guilt is overwhelming,”</strong> South Carolina Circuit Court Judge Clifton Newman said, rejecting a defense motion for a mistrial. He scheduled sentencing for Friday morning.</p><p>During the trial, no direct evidence was presented against him, such as a murder weapon, blood on his clothing, or an eyewitness. Instead, the case relied solely on circumstantial evidence.</p><p>The murders of <a href=#>Maggie</a> and <a href=#>Paul Murdaugh</a>, who were shot near the dog kennels on their family estate on June 7, 2021, have captured the attention of the country and inspired documentaries on Netflix and HBO.&nbsp;</p><p>The trial heard that Murdaugh had been stealing from his law partners and clients for years to support an addiction to painkillers and an extravagant lifestyle.</p><p>Murdaugh had pleaded not guilty to killing his wife and youngest son to conceal years of financial corruption, which he acknowledged in court.&nbsp;</p><p>He had claimed that someone angry over a deadly boating accident involving Paul in 2019 could have killed his son to seek revenge.</p><p><strong>“I would never hurt Maggie, and I would never hurt Paul – ever – under any circumstances,”</strong> Murdaugh testified.</p><p>The prosecution relied on an incriminating Snapchat video taken by Murdaugh’s son just before the murders.&nbsp;</p><p>In the video, the defendant’s voice could be heard in the background, despite his repeated claims that he had not been at the dog kennels that evening. Murdaugh admitted he had lied, saying his addiction to painkillers had put him in a paranoid state.</p><p>The trial also heard of Murdaugh’s bizarre attempt to stage his own death in an insurance fraud scheme just three months after he murdered his wife and son.</p><p>Prosecutors argued that it was Murdaugh’s financial crimes that drove him to murder – that he believed the deaths of Maggie and Paul would gain his sympathy and stave off a reckoning over his other misdeeds.</p><p>Several witnesses testified that on the night of the murders, Murdaugh had asked Maggie to return to their family estate, despite her preference for their other property in nearby Edisto Beach.&nbsp;</p><p>Jessica Williams, a 38-year-old resident, was outside the court during the proceedings, watching them on her phone while talking to her six-year-old daughter.&nbsp;</p><p>After the verdict was announced, she expressed her happiness to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">BBC News</a>, comparing the moment to when the verdict for OJ Simpson was delivered in 1995.</p><p>During the trial, Judge Newman allowed prosecutors to present evidence of Murdaugh’s alleged financial crimes, which investigators claim involved the theft of millions from clients and colleagues, including $3.7m (£3m) in 2019 alone.&nbsp;</p><p>Murdaugh also admitted to committing large-scale theft during the trial.</p><p>The prosecution alleged that Murdaugh had used one of the guns from his collection to kill Maggie and another to kill Paul. However, they were unable to find either firearm and produce them at trial.</p><p>After the jury’s verdict, Murdaugh was swiftly taken into custody, and sentencing was scheduled for the following day.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunCvxKWjZqiYpLumedWim56nXamurLHNZpmyZaCWwq15zK6pnZmlnLVw</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fcell-phone-video-taken-by-paul-murdaugh-serves-as-a-crucial-evidence.html&text=Cell%20Phone%20Video%20Taken%20By%20Paul%20Murdaugh%20Serves%20As%20A%20Crucial%20Evidence&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcell-phone-video-taken-by-paul-murdaugh-serves-as-a-crucial-evidence.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcell-phone-video-taken-by-paul-murdaugh-serves-as-a-crucial-evidence.html&title=Cell%20Phone%20Video%20Taken%20By%20Paul%20Murdaugh%20Serves%20As%20A%20Crucial%20Evidence" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fcell-phone-video-taken-by-paul-murdaugh-serves-as-a-crucial-evidence.html&title=Cell%20Phone%20Video%20Taken%20By%20Paul%20Murdaugh%20Serves%20As%20A%20Crucial%20Evidence" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fcell-phone-video-taken-by-paul-murdaugh-serves-as-a-crucial-evidence.html&title=Cell%20Phone%20Video%20Taken%20By%20Paul%20Murdaugh%20Serves%20As%20A%20Crucial%20Evidence" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcell-phone-video-taken-by-paul-murdaugh-serves-as-a-crucial-evidence.html&description=Cell%20Phone%20Video%20Taken%20By%20Paul%20Murdaugh%20Serves%20As%20A%20Crucial%20Evidence" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./how-does-stephen-baldwin-really-feel-about-hailey-and-justin-bieber-s-relationship.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How Does Stephen Baldwin Really Feel About Hailey And Justin Bieber's Relationship?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./billie-eilish-twerked-in-her-newest-tiktok-video-and-fans-are-obsessed.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Billie Eilish Twerked In Her Newest TikTok Video And Fans Are Obsessed">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
