This is precisely what he did when creating <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an episode of Seinfeld based on his terrible time on Saturday Night Live</a>. If rumors were or are true about his daughter's connection with John Mayer, he probably should start making notes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That's not to slag John Mayer. After all, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he's an exceptionally talented musician and songwriter</a> and appears to be a ton of fun. ...But John also has a reputation for hooking up with every gorgeous girl in Hollywood... And Cazzie David may not be an exception.</p><p>While very little is known about John Mayer's true relationship with Larry David's hilarious and absolutely stunning daughter, fans everywhere are wondering what's going on. So, let's unpack things a little bit, shall we?</p><h2 id=their-relationship-history-may-have-brought-them-to-this-point>Their Relationship History May Have Brought Them To This Point</h2><p>If you were to ask the 26-year-old Cazzie David what her relationship is with the 42-year-old John Mayer, she'd probably say "friends". At first glance, it does appear as though the two are friendly. They constantly support one another on their Instagram pages, whether it's John repping Cazzie's writing or Youtube videos or Cazzie promoting John's new music or charitable work.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But fans, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">particularly on Reddit</a>, believe that there's something more romantic or, at the very least, sexual going on between them. Perhaps their dating history makes them believe this...</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">17 Photos Of Cazzie David (Larry David Would Prefer We Not Look At)</a></span></p><p>Cazzie most notably dated Pete Davidson for two years before he moved on to<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> his turbulent relationship with Ariana Grande</a>. Before Pete, Cazzie David was linked to someone she described in a Youtube video for Vogue as "a long-term boyfriend". But other than that, her relationship history is pretty much mysterious. This is why so many fans have suspected something between her and John Mayer as they appear to spend quite a bit of time together.</p><p>Unlike Cazzie, John Mayer's relationship history is anything but mysterious. The dude has dated an onslaught of famous celebrities including Katy Perry, Minka Kelly, Cameron Diaz, Jennifer Love Hewitt, Rene Zellwegger, Rashida Jones, Jennifer Aniston, Jessica Simpson, and Taylor Swift... who just so happens to be friendly with Cazzie David... Hmm... we wonder how Taylor feels about her close friend getting cozy with her ex?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>We can't imagine Taylor being the type to be too thrilled with this, especially with John's reputation and the fact that she allegedly wrote "Dear John" about him.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Celebs John Mayer Has Dated (10 Who Wouldn’t Dare)</a></span></p><h2 id=cazzie-and-john-got-pretty-flirty-on-instagram-live>Cazzie and John Got Pretty Flirty On Instagram Live</h2><p>A few months after Cazzie and Pete ended their relationship, and during the hot-and-heavy relationship he had with Ariana Grande, Larry David's daughter showed off her connection to John Mayer. If anyone could make Pete Davidson jealous it's the handsome, multi-talented, charm-filled ladies man, John Mayer.</p><p>In October 2018, John invited Cazzie onto his Instagram Live Show "Current Mood" and things got steamy real fast. There appeared to be some flirtation between the two, especially as Cazzie asked John an onslaught of NSFW questions involving sex, the number of partners he's had, and how he likes to spend his alone time... if you know what we mean.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Then there was this:&nbsp;"How many girls have asked you to tell them their 'body is a wonderland?'"&nbsp;Cazzie&nbsp;asked him. "And can you say it to me after you answer the question?"</p><p>Of course, John did exactly that... Perhaps he had seen all of those thirst trap bikini photos on Cazzie's Instagram?</p><p>This sparked OK! Magazine to write a story about how there was something going on between them. they even interviewed an alleged "insider" who said, "The attraction is mutual. Cazzie's had her eyes on John for a while."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lee Brice Requests John Mayer for a Collaboration in his Upcoming Album</a></span></p><p>The following month, Cazzie attended a Mac Miller concert where John was also performing. Apparently, she was there only to see John...</p><p>Yeah, the tabloids had fun with that.</p><p>But Gossip Cop claims that there is absolutely nothing going on between them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sorry-folks-shipping-cazzie-and-john-is-a-waste-of-time>Sorry, Folks, Shipping Cazzie And John Is A Waste Of Time</h2><p>While there was some obvious flirtation between them, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sources say nothing ever materialized</a>... not a hookup and definitely not a relationship. The two are simply friends and get along quite well by the looks of things... Yeah, it's platonic, according to both Gossip Cop and Style Caster... Not to mention, both Cazzie and John appear to claim the same.</p><p>So, perhaps we should take their word for it? Or maybe it's just too fun to imagine what a Thanksgiving or Hannukah meal would look like if Cazzie brought John Mayer home to Larry David?</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Inside Jennifer Lawrence’s Secret Crush On Larry David</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroZ1dqb%2B2wMdmmJunpal6q7vHp2Smmamav7R50Z6jmqyZpLu0tMipZLChpJ16ra3Rq7BmnJGrtqW%2FjJ2Yrp%2BYqbKzecKasbOhlWQ%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fthe-truth-about-john-mayer-s-relationship-with-larry-david-s-daughter-cazzie.html&text=The%20Truth%20About%20John%20Mayer%27s%20Relationship%20With%20Larry%20David%27s%20Daughter%2c%20Cazzie&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-truth-about-john-mayer-s-relationship-with-larry-david-s-daughter-cazzie.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-truth-about-john-mayer-s-relationship-with-larry-david-s-daughter-cazzie.html&title=The%20Truth%20About%20John%20Mayer%27s%20Relationship%20With%20Larry%20David%27s%20Daughter%2c%20Cazzie" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fthe-truth-about-john-mayer-s-relationship-with-larry-david-s-daughter-cazzie.html&title=The%20Truth%20About%20John%20Mayer%27s%20Relationship%20With%20Larry%20David%27s%20Daughter%2c%20Cazzie" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fthe-truth-about-john-mayer-s-relationship-with-larry-david-s-daughter-cazzie.html&title=The%20Truth%20About%20John%20Mayer%27s%20Relationship%20With%20Larry%20David%27s%20Daughter%2c%20Cazzie" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-truth-about-john-mayer-s-relationship-with-larry-david-s-daughter-cazzie.html&description=The%20Truth%20About%20John%20Mayer%27s%20Relationship%20With%20Larry%20David%27s%20Daughter%2c%20Cazzie" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./upload-amazon-rhys-slack-birthday-age-height-parents-wiki-biography.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Upload Amazon: Rhys Slack Birthday, Age, Height, Parents, Wiki, Biography">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./sam-bakhtiar-net-worth-cause-of-death-age-instagram-wiki-biography-family.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Sam Bakhtiar Net Worth, Cause Of Death: Age, Instagram, Wiki, Biography, Family">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
