Titanic, James Cameron’s Titanic has gone down in filmmaking history as one of the most romantic, haunting, and cinematically impressive movies of all time, and <a href=#>said to cost more than the ship itself</a>! Even more than 20 years later, you’d be hard-pressed to find someone who hasn’t seen Titanic.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Playing the leading role of Rose DeWitt Bukater, a rich girl who falls in love with a boy from the third class while she’s engaged to someone else, Kate Winslet became a household name after starring in the film. She has since gone on to have a stellar career in the film industry with a long list of well-earned awards and accolades under her belt (<a href=#>even though she missed the Titanic premiere!</a>). While she wowed audiences with her performance, she seems to hold a different opinion of her portrayal of Rose. Keep reading to find out what Kate Winslet really thinks of her Titanic performance.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>15 Reasons Kate Winslet And Leonardo DiCaprio Are Still Friends Today</a></span></p><h2 id=she-hated-her-accent>She Hated Her Accent</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There are a few <a href=#>things that Kate Winslet regrets about her Titanic performance</a>. A lot of how she really feels about her iconic portrayal comes down to the accent she used. While her character Rose DeWitt Bukater was an American teenager living in the early 20th century, Winslet herself was born in Reading, in Great Britain. So to play the part of Rose effectively, she had to put on a specific American accent that wasn’t natural to her. And how does she feel about her American accent?</p><p>“I can’t listen to it. It’s awful,” she told The Telegraph (via Cheat Sheet).</p><p>Although <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Winslet reportedly can't stand this part of her performance</a>, the majority of fans would beg to differ. Many people couldn’t even tell that she wasn’t really American!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-rsquo-d-like-the-chance-to-do-it-again>She’d Like The Chance To Do It Again</h2><p>In the same interview with The Telegraph, Winslet made it clear that it wasn’t just the accent she took issue with in her performance. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">She called the entire performance awful</a> and even expressed a desire to re-do it now with the skills she’s gained since.</p><p>“Every single scene, I’m like, ‘Really, really? You did it like that?” she said (via Hollywood.com). “Hopefully it’s so much better now. It sounds terribly self-indulgent, but actors do tend to be very self-critical. I have a hard time watching any of my performances, but watching Titanic I was just like, ‘Oh god, I want to do that again.’”</p><p>So it’s safe to say that Winslet doesn’t look back fondly on her performance, even if the world fell in love with it!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Kate Winslet And Other Actors Who Regret Working With Woody Allen</a></span></p><h2 id=she-was-nervous-about-her-nude-scene>She Was Nervous About Her Nude Scene</h2><p>In one of Titanic’s most famous scenes, Kate Winslet’s character Rose takes off her robe so her love interest Jack Dawson (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) can sketch her. Though the scene is now iconic, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">one of the things that Winslet recalls from filming </a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Titanic</a> is that she was “absolutely nervous” about filming her nude scene.</p><p>She revealed that she found the strength to go through with it after working with fellow British film star Emma Thompson in Sense and Sensibility. “I had worked with Emma Thompson, who is a very physically open and relaxed person,” Winslet explained (via Entertainment Weekly), “and I had seen her do nudity and, you know, it was a part of the story.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Inspired by Thompson, Winslet found the courage to face her fear and get through the scene, which she believes was handled “quite beautifully.”</p><h2 id=the-press-gave-her-a-hard-time>The Press Gave Her A Hard Time</h2><p>Today, Titanic is remembered as one of the most iconic movies in history. But at the time, the press had a lot of negative comments to make about the film, even before it was released! It’s possible that the negativity she encountered in the press also caused Winslet to second-guess her performance.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>I think I was aware of all that negativity and I remember being quite upset by that ‘cause all I had done was quite innocently gone off and done a job and worked really hard and I was really excited about this film and all the lovely friends I had made,” the actress recounted (via Entertainment Weekly). She went on to say that she was baffled by “how sometimes the media can create a story around something before it’s even been given legs … or had a chance to walk or breathe.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here's Why Kate Winslet Is Unhappy About Her Titanic Legacy</a></span></p><h2 id=the-world-disagrees>The World Disagrees</h2><p>It’s not uncommon for artists to be especially hard on themselves, even when their audiences totally approve of their performances. Kate Winslet has come a long way since Titanic, so it’s understandable that she looks back at that early point in her career and cringes. But the world seems to disagree with her stance on it!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite the negative press that emerged before the release of the film, Winslet later received a Best Actress nomination for her performance as Rose. The film also arguably made her a household name.</p><h2 id=she-got-the-gig-without-auditioning>She Got The Gig Without Auditioning</h2><p>It’s also worth noting that director James Cameron was so impressed by Kate Winslet’s acting skills that he invited her to do a screen test for Rose without even auditioning her. At the time, Winslet was only 20 years old and working on Hamlet. She was flown to L.A. and asked to prepare some scenes for a series of camera tests, which were filmed while Winslet was in full costume.</p><p>After only two camera tests, Winslet was offered the role of Rose.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Kate Winslet Said Her Performance In This Film Was One Of Her Favorites</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHq4tMCtZKSZpJp6uLXNrKOerF2nsqK4y7JkraCfqrSpwIyonWaglad6tbXTmqWim12lsrOyzqukmqaTmnw%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fhere-s-what-kate-winslet-really-thought-of-her-titanic-performance.html&text=Here%27s%20What%20Kate%20Winslet%20Really%20Thought%20Of%20Her%20Titanic%20Performance&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhere-s-what-kate-winslet-really-thought-of-her-titanic-performance.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhere-s-what-kate-winslet-really-thought-of-her-titanic-performance.html&title=Here%27s%20What%20Kate%20Winslet%20Really%20Thought%20Of%20Her%20Titanic%20Performance" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fhere-s-what-kate-winslet-really-thought-of-her-titanic-performance.html&title=Here%27s%20What%20Kate%20Winslet%20Really%20Thought%20Of%20Her%20Titanic%20Performance" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fhere-s-what-kate-winslet-really-thought-of-her-titanic-performance.html&title=Here%27s%20What%20Kate%20Winslet%20Really%20Thought%20Of%20Her%20Titanic%20Performance" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhere-s-what-kate-winslet-really-thought-of-her-titanic-performance.html&description=Here%27s%20What%20Kate%20Winslet%20Really%20Thought%20Of%20Her%20Titanic%20Performance" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./julieth-lozano-wikipedia-edad-spouse-and-family-ethnicity.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Julieth Lozano Wikipedia Edad | Spouse And Family Ethnicity">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./day-26-tried-everything-before-booting-que.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Day 26 Tried Everything Before Booting Que">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
