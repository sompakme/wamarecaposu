Nick proposed to Jessica on a yacht in Hawaii during sunset, and after getting married, they started their own TV show Newlyweds: Nick & Jessica. The show was reportedly one of the reasons why <a href=#>they also got divorced</a>.</p><p>For a while, though, the two were an A-list couple and had fans fawning all over them.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>15 Surprising Things Jessica Simpson Has Recently Revealed</a></span></p><p>Being one of America’s most well-known sweethearts, Jessica Simpson couldn’t have had a simple and private life. <a href=#>Her legacy is often compared to the one of Britney Spears</a> due to the wrong portrayal by the media, her issues with drinking, and the many unsuccessful public relationships.</p><p>Unlike Britney Spears, she did not get her fame from singing, but more from being involved in different projects in the entertainment industry.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During her rise to fame, Jessica Simpson experienced all the good and bad sides of being an international celebrity.
