After discovering his musical talent, the artist began collaborating with <a href=#>famous artists like Drake</a> and Ariana Grande to build a strong fanbase. Today, the star has a $100 million net worth and a fleet of luxury cars and real estate properties to show for his growing fortune. His most recent purchase is a gorgeous Bel Air Mansion that he bought for an astonishing $70 million in October 2021. A few months before purchasing the luxurious property, the artist sold his Hidden Hills Home to Madonna for $19.3 million. While the home was just as lavish and opulent, <a href=#>The Weeknd wanted to make a shift</a> to an even more stylish home.</p><p>Adding to his real estate profile that contains two penthouses in LA and New York respectively and a Starboy mansion in Los Angeles, The Weeknd’s newest is his most extravagant purchase and the biggest real estate deal LA has witnessed this year. From having nothing at one point to having everything, let’s take a look inside The Weeknd’s $70 million mega-mansion.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=a-blinding-deal>A Blinding Deal</h2><p>The home was previously owned by a Dutch media mogul Reinout Oerlemans and his wife Danielle Oerlemans, a competitive cyclist. The couple purchased the home in 2015 for $12.4 million, and during the next three years, they added 13,000 sq. ft. of space to their dwelling to add more amenities, as stated by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Architecture Digest</a>. When the home was purchased, Oerlemans stated that the home's interior was shabby, but the couple saw potential and liked the location. They redesigned the entire interior working with renowned interior designers and importing furniture from around the world, including their homeland of the Netherlands.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Beyoncé And JAY-Z List Their New Orleans Mansion For $4.45 Million</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The couple had no plans to sell their property until Rayni, and Branden Williams from Beverly Hills Estate showed an interest in the home. They gave The Weeknd a tour of the estate, who immediately loved the home. The Williams represented Oerlemans while <a href=#>another agent from Beverly Hills Estate</a>, Angel Salvador, repped for The Weeknd. The off-market deal came with a $70 million price tag, which was multiple times more than the amount the couple spent.</p><h2 id=a-contemporary-elegance>A Contemporary Elegance</h2><p>The 33,000 sq. ft. mega-mansion is three times bigger than his previous Hidden Hills home. While the home had a Tuscan-style feel, the previous owners changed it into a chic and luxurious abode. The entrance of the property has giant double gates and a long driveway to reach the house. The formal living room features coffered ceilings with mirror panels, a black marble fireplace, and shiny orange walls. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dirt</a>, the home has nine bedrooms with lavishly decorated interiors.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The sprawling kitchen has two marble islands and floor-to-ceiling windows that offer a scenic view of the pool and golf courses. The kitchen is equipped with customized copper cabinets with leather belt handles that give it a rustic feel. The gourmet kitchen also comes with an array of high-end appliances that can fulfill every artist's need. For entertaining the guests, <a href=#>the Bel Air mansion features</a> a great outdoor bar and a lounge area near a fire pit for guests to sit and enjoy.</p><p>Everywhere the eye can go, the home has windows and glass walls to allow good lighting inside the rooms. Some rooms in the house have a hint of track lighting on ceilings, whereas the spacious formal dining room has an extravagant chandelier that looks like an exploding star, as noted by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Financial Post</a>.</p><h2 id=merging-indoors-and-outdoors>Merging Indoors And Outdoors</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The curvy three-story home offers ample terraces everywhere to bask in the warm Californian climate by interlinking the indoor structures to the outdoors. The house is equipped with <a href=#>every luxury amenity imaginable</a>. It has a spa, a Turkish-style hammam, a movie theatre, a gym, and a music studio indoors. For the outdoors, the mansion has an infinity pool with waterfalls and an open tennis court that offer a direct view of the Bel-Air Country Club.</p><p>The landscape of lush green trees and shrubs surrounds the entire estate, giving it a mysterious feel. As mentioned by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fancy Pants Homes</a>, The Weeknd’s exclusive estate has no neighbors around, which is a perfect escape for the artist to wind down and get some privacy that he needs away from the media. The modern extravagance of this home is the epitome of luxury and truly suits the larger-than-life personality of The Weeknd.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Once a couch-surfer from Canada, The Weeknd has come a long way from his days living in low-grade apartments. His ever-growing fortune and expenses are proof that pure talent can take success to bigger heights every time. While the artist has just bought the property in October 2021, everyone is waiting to see how the Grammy winner redesigns his home.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>An Aerial Arsenal: Inside Bill Gates' Aircraft Collection</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Architecture Digest</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dirt</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Financial Post</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fancy Pants Homes</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6ecCrmqGhpJqwtcHRnmatoJVir6qzxp6qrWWUmq6tv4yipWakkWKubrzEnqJmoZ6otqWxjK2fnmWnmrKsusOsZHBoXaK2rbjIqKVmpZWcrm65wKeqoqeeZA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fa-peek-inside-the-weeknd-s-70-million-mega-mansion.html&text=A%20Peek%20Inside%20The%20Weeknd%27s%20%2470%20Million%20Mega%20Mansion&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fa-peek-inside-the-weeknd-s-70-million-mega-mansion.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fa-peek-inside-the-weeknd-s-70-million-mega-mansion.html&title=A%20Peek%20Inside%20The%20Weeknd%27s%20%2470%20Million%20Mega%20Mansion" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fa-peek-inside-the-weeknd-s-70-million-mega-mansion.html&title=A%20Peek%20Inside%20The%20Weeknd%27s%20%2470%20Million%20Mega%20Mansion" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fa-peek-inside-the-weeknd-s-70-million-mega-mansion.html&title=A%20Peek%20Inside%20The%20Weeknd%27s%20%2470%20Million%20Mega%20Mansion" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fa-peek-inside-the-weeknd-s-70-million-mega-mansion.html&description=A%20Peek%20Inside%20The%20Weeknd%27s%20%2470%20Million%20Mega%20Mansion" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./fixer-to-fabulous-favorite-chase-looney-lost-his-eye-from-an-accident-here-is-an-update.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Fixer To Fabulous Favorite Chase Looney Lost His Eye From An Accident, Here Is An Update">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./10-celebs-who-went-from-rich-to-broke.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="10 Celebs Who Went From Rich To Broke">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
