So the idea of a fan ever developing a relationship with a celebrity seems like an impossible and improbable fairy tale. Basically, it almost sounds like the modern day Cinderella story, or the plot of a very cheesy romantic movie. However, the following love stories will probably give hope to every fan that has ever swooned over a celebrity or daydreamed about spending even a single moment with them. Here are eight celebrities that found love in a hopeless place, when they married their biggest fans.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=john-travolta>8. John Travolta</h2><p>In 1991, <a title="John Travolta Net Worth" href=#>John Travolta</a> married longtime fan, <a title="Kelly Preston Net Worth" href=#>Kelly Preston</a>. Preston once commented on her burning desire for her idol John Travolta stating, "I came out of a film, saw the poster for Grease and I knew I’d be with him. I just knew. I was about 16 years old.&nbsp;I really knew it and it turned into, ‘I’m going to marry that man’" - and thirteen years later, she did. This was a true and incredible story of a celebrity marrying their biggest fan. The two have been married for twenty-three years and have three children together. However, Kelly and John suffered a great loss when their eldest son, Jett passed away unexpectedly due to a seizure in 2009. After suffering such an immense tragedy, the couple attended marriage counseling in order to repair their family and marriage, John credits his family for being able to survive after the death of his son, and in moving forward with his life and his career.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=jessica-alba>7. Jessica Alba</h2><p><a title="Jessica Alba Net Worth" href=#>Jessica Alba</a> met <a title="Cash Warren Net Worth" href=#>Cash Warren</a>, a production assistant while filming Fantastic Four, in 2004. Cash was a big fan of Alba and her work, from her 90's films to her television series&nbsp;Dark Angel. The two reportedly hit it off and had an instant attraction to one another. They began dating while working on the set of Fantastic Four. In 2008, the couple got married and they now have two children together.</p><p></p><h2 id=kelsey-grammer>6. Kelsey Grammer</h2><p><a title="Kelsey Grammer Net Worth" href=#>Kelsey Grammer</a> is well known for starring in the two long-running TV series,&nbsp;Cheers and Frasier.&nbsp;With twenty plus years of starring on hit television series, it's no surprise that Grammer had a large amount of female fans. In 2010, Kelsey met British flight attendant and huge Cheers and Frasier fan, Kayte Walsh. The two began a relationship together, despite the fact that Kelsey was still married to his third wife,&nbsp;The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star,&nbsp;Camille Donatici. In February 2011, Grammer divorced Camille and just two weeks later, he married Kayte Walsh. Kayte and Kelsey have one child together and just announced in March 2014, that they are expecting a second child.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=julia-roberts>5. Julia Roberts</h2><p>America's sweetheart, <a title="Julia Roberts Net Worth" href=#>Julia Roberts</a> has dated famous fellow celebrities such as, <a title="Matthew Perry Net Worth" href=#>Matthew Perry</a>, <a title="Kiefer Sutherland Net Worth" href=#>Kiefer Sutherland</a>, <a title="Liam Neeson Net Worth" href=#>Liam Neeson</a> and <a title="Dylan McDermott Net Worth" href=#>Dylan McDermott</a>. In 2000, cameraman Daniel Moder caught Roberts eye while she was filming the movie,&nbsp;The Mexican. At the time, Moder was married and Roberts was in a three year relationship. Moder divorced his wife to begin a relationship with his idol and Roberts called it quits with her boyfriend of three years to pursue a relationship with her fan. Julia and Daniel married in 2002 and they now have three children together.</p><p></p><h2 id=nicolas-cage>4. Nicolas Cage</h2><p>Similarly to Julia Roberts,&nbsp;<a title="Nicolas Cage Net Worth" href=#>Nicolas Cage</a>&nbsp;had his fair share of dating big name celebrities. He has dated <a title="Brooke Shields Net Worth" href=#>Brooke Shields</a>, <a title="Sarah Jessica Parker Net Worth" href=#>Sarah Jessica Parker</a>, <a title="Angelina Jolie Net Worth" href=#>Angelina Jolie</a> and has been married to <a title="Patricia Arquette net Worth" href=#>Patricia Arquette</a> and <a title="Lisa Marie Presley Net Worth" href=#>Lisa Marie Presley</a>. In 2004, Cage met waitress, Alice Kim at a restaurant she was serving at. Kim asked for an autograph and ended up getting a phone number, too. The two married that same year at a private ranch in Northern California and had a child together, in October 2005. Despite Cage's financial difficulties due to owing the IRS $13 million in back taxes, Nicholas and Alice have been happily married for ten years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=matt-damon>3. Matt Damon</h2><p><a title="Matt Damon Net Worth" href=#>Matt Damon</a> has dated a couple of famous actresses including, <a title="Winona Ryder Net Worth" href=#>Winona Ryder</a> and <a title="Minnie Driver Net Worth" href=#>Minnie Driver</a>, but it was Miami bartender, Luciana Bozan that captured his heart. The two met while Matt was filming the movie,&nbsp;Stuck on You in 2003 in Miami, Florida. Damon had entered the establishment Luciana was working in and he hid behind the bar to escape a slew of fans. Luciana was a big fan of Matt Damon, but he didn't make any attempt to try to escape her. The two hit it off and married in 2005. They have three children together and Matt is also step-father to Bozan's daughter from a previous marriage.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=anne-hathaway>2. Anne Hathaway</h2><p><a title="Anne Hathaway Net Worth" href=#>Anne Hathaway</a> found love in a hopeless place once before, but that love was terminated when the police kicked in the door to her home, to arrest her money laundering boyfriend, Raffaello Follieri in 2008. After that incident, Hathaway had no interest in dating anyone for a very long time - but that same year, Anne was introduced to <a title="Adam Shulman Net Worth" href=#>Adam Shulman</a> by mutual friends. Shulman was a jewelry designer and a small bit actor. He was also a huge fan of Hathaway and her work. Despite Anne's plans to stay single, she fell in love with Adam and four years later, the couple married. The couple has been happily married for two years and unlike her previous relationship, the police have not been involved in this one.</p><p></p><h2 id=patrick-dempsey>1. Patrick Dempsey</h2><p><a title="Patrick Dempsey Net Worth" href=#>Patrick Dempsey</a>, who is best known for his role as Dr. Shepherd on the hit TV series Grey's Anatomy&nbsp;found love in a hair salon, when he met hairstylist and makeup artist, Jillian Fink in 1999. Although Dempsey wasn't really famous yet, he was famous enough, for Fink to be a fan of his work. The couple married in 1999 and they currently have three children together. Fifteen years later, they're still married and Jillian still cuts Patrick's hair.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmnrCgmru0tdWeZKWhlprAtcXLnmZxZZOauaau0aKrop2jYsGprdNmpJqqop6ypXnToZyiql2XtqizxKyrZp6Ro8Bw</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f8-celebrities-that-married-their-biggest-fans.html&text=8%20Celebrities%20That%20Married%20Their%20Biggest%20Fans&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f8-celebrities-that-married-their-biggest-fans.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f8-celebrities-that-married-their-biggest-fans.html&title=8%20Celebrities%20That%20Married%20Their%20Biggest%20Fans" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f8-celebrities-that-married-their-biggest-fans.html&title=8%20Celebrities%20That%20Married%20Their%20Biggest%20Fans" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f8-celebrities-that-married-their-biggest-fans.html&title=8%20Celebrities%20That%20Married%20Their%20Biggest%20Fans" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f8-celebrities-that-married-their-biggest-fans.html&description=8%20Celebrities%20That%20Married%20Their%20Biggest%20Fans" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./erasmo-provenza.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Erasmo Provenza">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./10-most-expensive-tv-shows-ever-made.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="10 Most Expensive TV Shows Ever Made">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
