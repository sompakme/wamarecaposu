In a time of extreme censorship on terrestrial radio, that meant really pushing boundaries. While he's grown both as a man and as a performer over the past couple of decades, in the late 1980s, he was at the height of his most debaucherous and controversial comedic bits.</p><p>One of these bits involved confronting comedian Elayne Boosler at the Grammy Awards. The interaction was so negative that it resulted in her manager/boyfriend punching him in the face. Here's what happened...</p><h2 id=howard-stern-was-punched-in-the-face-by-elayne-boosler-39-s-manager-and-boyfriend>Howard Stern Was Punched In The Face By Elayne Boosler's Manager And Boyfriend</h2><p>According to The Washington Post, the<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> incident between Howard Stern and Elayne Boosler's manager/boyfriend Steve Gerbson</a> occurred in 1989. The former shock jock, who became famous on Dc-101 in Washington, D.C. and then became most associated with New York, attended the 1989 Grammy's in Los Angeles. This is where he came across acclaimed comedian, Elayne Boosler.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/howard-stern-was-beat-up-by-this-famous-comedian-s-boyfriend-after-he-insulted-her-front-deposit-back-letterman_youtube.jpg><ul><li><strong>Elayne Boosler was born in 1952</strong></li><li><strong>Boosler was best known as a stand-up comedian</strong></li><li><strong>Boosler was a regular performer at The Comedy Store</strong></li><li><strong>Boosler has been married to Bill Siddons since 2007</strong></li></ul><p>At the time, Stern was trying to get Boosler to come onto his show. While Stern has become known for his profound and downright entertaining celebrity interviews, he once really pushed their buttons. His<a href=#> staffers even attempted to get stars to storm off the air in a huff</a>. So, only the bravest and most open would dare go on The Howard Stern Show. These celebrities also had to have a sense of humor about themselves. While Elayne Boosler may have been self-effacing, it's clear she wanted nothing to do with Howard Stern who, at the time, was relentlessly mocking her deodorant commercials on his show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><ul><li><strong>Boosler famously stopped being invited on The Johnny Carson show after refusing to do material making fun of herself</strong></li></ul><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/howard-stern-slammed-amy-robach-and-tj-holmes-boring-podcast.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Howard Stern Slammed Former GMA Hosts Amy Robach And TJ Holmes For What Happened To Their Career</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Howard Stern didn't get the buzz around Robach and Holmes' GMA affair, and he certainly didn't think it was worth an entire podcast.</span><p>When Howard Stern came across Boosler at The Grammy's he started shouting at her through a bullhorn, according to The Washington Post. This caused Boosler's manager and then-boyfriend Steve Gerbson to confront the radio legend. This resulted in Gerbson shoving the bullhorn in Stern's face and then punching him in the mouth.</p><p>During a 1989 interview on The Howard Stern Show with Simpsons star Harry Shearer, Peter Max, and acclaimed musician Graham Nash, the radio legend explained his side of the story.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/your-paragraph-text-2024-01-01t141821-794.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After asking Graham Nash to do perform his hit song "Right Between The Eyes", Stern said, "C'mon, I got hit today right between the eyes, you could at least do, 'Right Between The Eyes".</p><p>"Where's the mark?

In real life, Stern has a reputation for being reclusive and quite sweet. At least according to the numerous celebrities who come on his show or talk about him in public. But Stern's on-air persona is another matter entirely.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/howard-stern-slammed-reports-that-simon-cowell-had-him-fired-here-s-the-real-reason-he-left-america-s-got-talent.jpg><p>The radio legends often picks fights with celebrities. Sometimes they cause Stern to go into lenghty rants on his show. Other times, he actually argues with them to their face or over the phone.

Although, anyone who listens to the SiriusXM radio program knows that this is also for entertainment purposes. Stern also often provokes on-air arguments between his employees.
