It might have started off on the big screen, but it has <a href=#>shelled out millions to head to television</a>, and this decision has been a brilliant one by the franchise.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So far, the MCU has done amazing work on TV. The franchise has done a great job of mixing things up on TV, and it even has <a href=#>a dark Halloween special coming out</a>.</p><p>Back in the day, the MCU's TV offerings weren't quite as great, and one forgotten show went down in flames.</p><p>Let's take a look back at what happened with Inhumans.</p><h2 id=what-happened-to-the-mcu-39-s-39-inhumans-39>What Happened To The MCU's 'Inhumans'?</h2><p>When it was announced that the MCU was going to be heading to the small screen to unleash a torrent of fresh material in 2021, fans could not wait to see what the franchise was going to do. It became clear early on that these projects were going to be a lot different from the movies, and since the debut of WandaVision, the franchise has been delivering exceptional television work.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>WandaVision was a trippy look at the inner workings of Wanda dealing with her trauma by way of sitcom life, and it was a fascinating watch. This was followed up by The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, which felt closer to an MCU movie than anything we have seen thus far.</p><p>Those first two shows really set the stage for Loki, which was a mystery thriller that unleashed the Multiverse on the franchise. Fans also got What If..., which traveled through alternate timelines, and they got Hawkeye, which was a more family-friendly affair.</p><p>This year, there are going to be several new shows, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">it all starts with Moon Knight</a>, a show that hits a Disney+ soon</p><p>Now, everything is looking great for the MCU on TV, but the franchise had a really odd start to things. Inhumans is a perfect example of what we mean.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's What Marvel Fans Are Saying About The First Look At 'She-Hulk'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=39-inhumans-39-was-an-earlier-offering>'Inhumans' Was An Earlier Offering</h2><p>Don't remember Inhumans being on TV? Well, you're not alone. Unfortunately, this project, which was initially intended to be a film, got off to a horrific start, and it was never able to get its feet underneath it.</p><p>There was a lot of hype that Marvel tried to place on the show, and it even made its debut on the big screen by way of IMAX screens. Longtime fans were really excited to see what this show was going to bring to the table and how it would expand as a franchise, but they had little idea just how bad this show would be.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Not only did it have the Marvel brand behind it, but the characters themselves are pretty popular in the pages. Throw in the fact that talented performers like Anson Mount, Serinda Swan, and more were on board, and it's easy to look back and see why there was excitement around Inhumans.</p><p>Unfortunately, this show was a huge swing and a miss, and it was removed from daylight in the blink of an eye.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Was Marisa Tomei Doing Before Becoming The MCU's Aunt May?</a></span></p><h2 id=why-it-was-axed-so-quickly>Why It Was Axed So Quickly?</h2><p>So, why in the world was Inhumans canceled so quickly? Well, there were certainly several things that play here, one of which was the fact that the project itself had a horrific reception.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even the lower tier Marvel projects that get released find some semblance of success. Many people don't like Thor: The Dark World, but it was still a hit movie. Unfortunately, people didn't like Inhumans, and no one talks about the show anymore.</p><p>As if that wasn't bad enough, the show also had terrible ratings. Simply put, no one was tuning in to give the show a chance, and the ones that actually rolled the dice on the show didn't like what the franchise was bringing to the table.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CBR</a> had a great summary of the show's demise, writing, "Scott Buck, showrunner of Iron Fist Season 1, was the showrunner for Inhumans as well, but reviews were brutal and the series was maligned by critics and fans alike. The storyline felt rushed, undeveloped and boring, and viewership only lessened as Inhumans reached its eighth and final episode."</p><p>Yeah, it was bad, and to this very day, you won't hear any glowing reviews about the ill-fated show. Actually, to be quite honest, you won't really hear anyone talking about it at all, which is somehow worse.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Is Marvelâ€™s â€˜Moon Knightâ€™ Setting Up The Debut Of This Legendary Team?</a></span></p><p>Inhumans dropped the ball years back, but thankfully, Marvel figured out the TV sphere and is off and running these days.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>How Is Brie Larson Getting Ripped For 'The Marvels'?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdrK60ecyaqa%2BdnKh6qrrHrqSapqNisKK6wp6jpZ2UZA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhy-was-marvel-s-inhumans-cancelled-so-quickly.html&text=Why%20Was%20Marvel%27s%20%27Inhumans%27%20Cancelled%20So%20Quickly%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhy-was-marvel-s-inhumans-cancelled-so-quickly.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-was-marvel-s-inhumans-cancelled-so-quickly.html&title=Why%20Was%20Marvel%27s%20%27Inhumans%27%20Cancelled%20So%20Quickly%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhy-was-marvel-s-inhumans-cancelled-so-quickly.html&title=Why%20Was%20Marvel%27s%20%27Inhumans%27%20Cancelled%20So%20Quickly%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-was-marvel-s-inhumans-cancelled-so-quickly.html&title=Why%20Was%20Marvel%27s%20%27Inhumans%27%20Cancelled%20So%20Quickly%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhy-was-marvel-s-inhumans-cancelled-so-quickly.html&description=Why%20Was%20Marvel%27s%20%27Inhumans%27%20Cancelled%20So%20Quickly%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./10-facts-you-never-knew-about-mila-kunis.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="10 Facts You Never Knew About Mila Kunis">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./who-is-lil-hunter-kelly-everything-to-know-about-the-comedian.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Lil Hunter Kelly?
