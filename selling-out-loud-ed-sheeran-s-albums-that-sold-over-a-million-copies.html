He was inspired by singer-songwriter Damien Rice to pursue a career as a musical artist when he attended his concert at the age of 11. Sheeran was only 14 when he started <a href=#>selling his recordings</a> and released his music in 2006 and 2007. He played music in local London circuits during the time. In 2010, he was asked to perform an opening act for rapper Example during his tour. Sheeran met Jamie Foxx the same year he moved to the United States and signed on to Atlantic Records. He began writing for One Direction and Taylor Swift before releasing his first studio album in 2011.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ed Sheeran has been on a roll since his first album and has accomplished the feat of selling over a million copies worldwide.
