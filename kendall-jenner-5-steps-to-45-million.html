As a trade-off for allowing cameras to follow her every move and document some of her most personal moments, Kendall Jenner is said to be making 7 figures for her time she invests in the reality television show, Keeping Up With The Kardashians.</p><p>This is especially impressive, considering that between all the other siblings, and all the things they have going on in their lives, Kendall isn't the most featured on the show. She spends less time filming this program than the rest of the Kardashian-Jenner girls, and still brings home the same 7-figure income that they do.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kendall Jenner Launching Her Own Tequila Brand</a></span></p><h2 id=endorsements>Endorsements</h2><p>Kendall Jenner is no stranger to the lucrative income that can be obtained through simple endorsements. She has been connected to a series of endorsement deals, each of which pays her handsomely to become the face of their brand.</p><p>Her most famous endorsement deal was her controversial ad for Pepsi, which was seemingly a great idea until it quickly turned into a controversial uproar. When the commercial aired, many viewers felt that it mocked and minimized the struggles of Black citizens and the real issues surrounding police brutality. In spite of the epic fail and the tone-deaf nature of the ad itself, Kendall made a fortune on the endorsement deal, with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People </a>citing that she earned somewhere in the range of $400,000 - $1 million for the failed ad campaign.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She has also been linked to a variety of advertisement and endorsement deals for major brands such as&nbsp;Adidas, Fendi, EstÃ©e Lauder, Marc Jacobs, and Calvin Klein. Kendall gets paid so well for these endorsements that when combined, her endorsement deals pay out more than anything else that she does, earning her millions of dollars to add towards her already massive net worth.</p><h2 id=sponcon>#Sponcon</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Not everything that Jenner touches is a huge success when it's out there in the world, and her endorsement deal with Pepsi was an example of this. She happened to earn some other forms of highly controversial income as well. Fans had more questions than answers when they found out that Kendall Jenner had been paid a whopping $250,000 to endorse the Fyre Festival in 2017. For those who are unaware, that was her one-time payment for one simple promotion she posted on her Instagram page, and sadly, the entire event ended up being a scam. The festival promised a series of performances by huge artists as well as luxury stays at hotels and food service, etc. As it turns out, she was paid to promote a scam - the artists did not show up at all, and fans were left with far-less than the luxurious accommodations they had been promised.</p><h2 id=modeling>Modeling</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kendall Jenner has gone from being a reality TV star based on the cultivated success of her family name, to being a full-blown, internationally acclaimed supermodel in her own right. She has managed to establish a professional modeling career for herself that is completely independent of her family's success, and has soared to new heights with this career move. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Forbes</a> has confirmed that Kendall is the highest paid supermodel in the entire world, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">beating out the likes of Bella Hadid, Gigi Hadid,</a> and even Gisele Bundchen.</p><p>To put things in perspective, Kendall demands a jaw-dropping $22 million for her modeling appearances, as compared to the competition which <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cheatsheet </a>reports as being; "Gisel BÃ¼ndchen, who made $17.5 million for her modeling career in 2017 Chrissy Teigen, bringing in $13.5 million and Adriana Lima at $10.5 million. Gigi Hadid came in at $9.5 million for the year."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tequila-818>Tequila 818</h2><p>Kendall Jenner hasn't started earning money in this category yet, but with the new launch of her very own Tequila brand called 818 Tequila,<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> she sits perfectly poised to earn millions</a> more through this savvy business venture. Trying her luck in the world of celebrity alcohol brands, Kendall has worked tirelessly for 4 long years to bring her own brand of tequila to the world. She launched her brand officially in May of 2021, and expects her tequila to be an instant success among fans and fellow tequila lovers across the globe.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Most Memed Moments From Keeping Up With The Kardashians</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cheatsheet, </a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Forbes</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS4prrDmqOlZZqau6%2Bx0WaqrZ2gqHqztcKhnKxlnZ65rbXOp6po</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fkendall-jenner-5-steps-to-45-million.html&text=Kendall%20Jenner%3a%205%20Steps%20To%20%2445%20Million&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fkendall-jenner-5-steps-to-45-million.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fkendall-jenner-5-steps-to-45-million.html&title=Kendall%20Jenner%3a%205%20Steps%20To%20%2445%20Million" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fkendall-jenner-5-steps-to-45-million.html&title=Kendall%20Jenner%3a%205%20Steps%20To%20%2445%20Million" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fkendall-jenner-5-steps-to-45-million.html&title=Kendall%20Jenner%3a%205%20Steps%20To%20%2445%20Million" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fkendall-jenner-5-steps-to-45-million.html&description=Kendall%20Jenner%3a%205%20Steps%20To%20%2445%20Million" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./lauren-london-net-worth-how-much-is-london-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Lauren London Net Worth  How Much is London Worth?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./damon-wayans-jr-news-us-weekly.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="damon wayans jr.
