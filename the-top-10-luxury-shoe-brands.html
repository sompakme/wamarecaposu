Women always seem to have a reason and justification to buy a new pair. Some would rather go hungry than bypass the latest pair from the most popular brand. In Imelda Marcos’ case, she would rather see her people go hungry than pass up the chance to collect 3,000 pairs. At that rate, she need not repeat a pair even if she wears a new one every day for more than eight years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Such is the power of shoes over women, and this is even more pronounced if the most popular brands are involved. Here is a list of the top 10 luxury shoe brands in the world.</p><h2 id=1-jimmy-choo><b>1. Jimmy Choo</b></h2><p>This is one of the most sought-after shoe brands in the world. Stars like Cate Blanchett, Hillary Swank and Halle Berry have worn a pair to the Academy Awards. Just like the shoe, all three have come out as winners. The brand was launched in the middle part of the 1980s in London. The shoes always feature excellent artistry, thus allowing the brand to gain a loyal following.</p><h2 id=2-christian-louboutin><b>2. Christian Louboutin</b></h2><p>Christian Loboutin made the high heels even higher. Hard as it is to walk with, the trend has caught on and is probably here to stay. The shoes from this luxury brand are instantly recognizable by a bright red sole that has become its signature. The French footwear designer has been counterfeited so many times that the company has actually put up a site dedicated solely to identifying the fake stores.&nbsp; It has even sued Yves Saint Laurent for trademark infringement.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=3-manolo-blahnik><b>3. Manolo Blahnik</b></h2><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p>Have you ever watched “Sex and the City?” The lead character named Carrie Bradshaw was so into Manolo Blahnik that she was so hesitant to give it up when a thief victimized her. The shoes from this luxury brand symbolize a classic style. It is hard to imagine that it actually went against the grain in the middle part of the 1970s. Back then, the popular designs were boots and chunky platform shoes. Blahnik ignored the trend and instead focused his attention to creating the stiletto heel. The move paid off, and this design has become its mainstay up to now.</p><h2 id=4-louis-vuitton><b>4. Louis Vuitton</b></h2><p>What is not to love about Louis Vuitton products? They are elegant, classy, stylish and extremely fashionable. All these go along with the brand’s excellent craftsmanship, quality of work and comfort. Louis Vuitton is a symbol of excellence and this extends to the shoes that it creates.</p><h2 id=5-walter-steiger><b>5. Walter Steiger</b></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Walter Steiger has been known for his unique and innovative designs that have practically changed the entire shoe industry. The brand’s creations are considered as classics. The brand has been around since 1932 when it used to tailor shoes to an exclusive client list. It has since worked with some of the leading fashion houses and designers like Calvin Klein, Karl Lagerfeld, Nina Ricci and Oscar de la Renta.</p><h2 id=6-alexander-mcqueen><b>6. Alexander McQueen</b></h2><p>Alexander McQueen was known as a fashion designer who headed the design team in Givenchy in the middle part of the 1990s. Women know him for his luxury shoe line that was both cutting edge and classic at the same time. His shoes combined the beauty and elegance of 16th century design with the modern looks and practicality we have today. The shoes were intriguing and much coveted by shoe lovers.</p><h2 id=7-brian-atwood><b>7. Brian Atwood</b></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>His shoes are renowned for their excellent craftsmanship and superior quality. They are made in Italy and they have been described as the type that would make other people stop and stare. The remarkable thing about Brian Atwood’s shoes is its availability to enhance a woman’s legs. The stilettos were made in such a way that the wearer’s limbs would look long and lean, even as it maintains a comfort that is often sacrificed in the name of aesthetics. The luxury brand also has high thigh boots that are sold at a high price point, which reflects its quality and emphasizes its exclusivity.</p><h2 id=8-stuart-weitzman><b>8. Stuart Weitzman</b></h2><p>Stuart Weitzman is known for his one-of-a-kind, million-dollar shoes. He usually provides it to a nominee in the annual Academy Awards where the fashion in the red carpet is scrutinized to the very last detail. There was a bit of controversy in 2007, however, when the woman that Weitzman chose declined to wear the shoes. The company’s trademark is the use of unique materials not usually used for shoemaking. These include such materials as cork, vinyl, Lucite, wallpaper and 24-karat gold.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=9-miu-miu><b>9. Miu Miu</b></h2><p>Miu Miu is a high fashion brand whose name was taken from the nickname of its head, Miuccia Prada. It has since evolved into one of the most popular brand of shoes in the world. It brings a sophisticated style while maintaining a youthful outlook. To emphasize this point, Miu Miu even appointed Hailee Steinfeld, an actress who was only 14 years old, to be the face of the brand. This only lasted for one year, however, with Miu Miu turning to the more mature Guinevere van Seenus, an American model who is 34 years old, to endorse the brand for its most recent campaign. Not that it is short of endorsers, as celebrities like Katie Holmes, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Lindsay Lohan, Laetitia Casta, Chloe Sevigny and Kirsten Dunst all swear by the beauty and quality of the product.</p><h2 id=10-gucci><b>10. Gucci</b></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Back in 1990, the Gucci fashion house was in trouble. Sales were dwindling and its prestige was eroding. Enter Tom Ford, a relatively unknown American, who was appointed the chief ready-to-wear designer for women’s clothing. Ford’s role rapidly expanded after that, eventually taking over the men’s and shoe lines. The fashionable new shoe designs made Gucci an instant classic. This soon evolved into a loyal following, thus helping the company turn around from near-bankruptcy to a billion-dollar luxury brand enterprise. Gucci shoes were especially commended for its quality and comfort.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqttdKtZq2glWLBsLyMamdmpKWtwrPFjKyfqJ1dl7%2BiusOsZg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fthe-top-10-luxury-shoe-brands.html&text=The%20Top%2010%20Luxury%20Shoe%20Brands&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-top-10-luxury-shoe-brands.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-top-10-luxury-shoe-brands.html&title=The%20Top%2010%20Luxury%20Shoe%20Brands" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fthe-top-10-luxury-shoe-brands.html&title=The%20Top%2010%20Luxury%20Shoe%20Brands" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fthe-top-10-luxury-shoe-brands.html&title=The%20Top%2010%20Luxury%20Shoe%20Brands" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-top-10-luxury-shoe-brands.html&description=The%20Top%2010%20Luxury%20Shoe%20Brands" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./15-funny-valentine-s-day-gifts-to-shop-now.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="15 Funny Valentines Day Gifts to Shop Now">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./nfl-royalty-a-look-at-the-richest-nfl-coaches-of-all-time.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="NFL Royalty: A Look At The Richest NFL Coaches Of All Time">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
