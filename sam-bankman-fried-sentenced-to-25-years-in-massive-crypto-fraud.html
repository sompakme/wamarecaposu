Common derivatives include futures contracts, forwards, options, and swaps."</p><p>Trading technicalities aside, the fact remains that Sam Bankman-Fried's net worth reached a monstrous $26.5 billion within a few years, and he was ranked the twenty-fifth richest person in America ... before it all came crashing down.</p><p>All it took was "one week in [November] 2022" for SBF <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">to lose it all and face charges</a> of fraud and conspiracy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In addition to his sentence, SBF was ordered to pay $11 billion in forfeitures, which is different from restitution, and does not go directly to those directly impacted by the fall of FTX.</p><p>United States Federal District Court Judge Lewis Kaplan <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">said it would be</a> "impractical" to order restitution, because the case was too complicated and the pool of affected investors too vast.</p><p>Kaplan did, however, indicate that the government could use funds generated by the liquidation of Bankman-Fried's seized assets to compensate victims of the multi-billion dollar scheme.</p><p>SBF has <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">finally broken his silence</a>, writing in a recent Substack post: "I didnâ€™t steal funds, and I certainly didnâ€™t stash billions away." In the same post, Bankman-Fried endeavored to explain exactly what happened to investors' billions.</p><p>With his sentencing, 32-year-old SBF joined an exclusive club of billionaires behind bars for defrauding customers and investors.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So, where does the disgraced wunderkind rank among his fellow white-collar criminals?</p><p>Editorâ€™s note: This article contains brief mentions of sexual assault, abuse, or other related topics that could be triggering to some readers and survivors.
