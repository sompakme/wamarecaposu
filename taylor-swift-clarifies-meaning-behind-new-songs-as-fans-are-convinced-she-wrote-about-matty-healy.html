I liked it there, it was weird but it was cool, come back!'"</strong></p><p>"The character in the song just felt like, 'I've just been exposed to a whole different galaxy and universe I didn’t know was possible, how can you put me somewhere I was before?'"

She explained it's about "being somebody’s favorite toy until they break you and then don’t want to play with you anymore — which is how a lot of us are in relationships where we are so valued by a person in the beginning, and then all of the sudden, they break us or they devalue us in their mind."</strong></p><p>"We’re still clinging on to 'No no, no. You should’ve seen them the first time they saw me. They’ll come back to that. They’ll get back to that,'" she added. "So it’s kind of like a song about denial, really, so that you can live in this world where there’s still hope for a toxic broken relationship."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-songs-also-talked-about-women-in-the-entertainment-industry>The Songs Also Talked About Women In The Entertainment Industry</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/taylor-swift-the-tortured-poets-department.png><p>Taylor Swift also spoke in depth about the role of women in the entertainment industry, and how they're pitted against each other from the very beginning. Her song "Clara Bow", of course, references the famous actress, and Taylor called it "a commentary on what I’ve seen in the industry that I’ve been in over time."</p><p><strong>"I used to sit in record labels trying to get a record deal when I was a little kid," she shared, "and they'd say, 'You know, you remind us of...' and then they'd name an artist, and then they'd kind of say something disparaging about her, 'But you're this, you’re so much better in this way or that way.' And that's how we teach women to see themselves, as, like, 'You could be the new replacement for this woman who’s done something great before you.'"</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She also name-dropped Stevie Nicks in the song, addressing the similarities people point out between the two singers, calling the Fleetwood Mac leader "an icon and an incredible example for anyone who wants to write songs and make music."</p><p><strong>As fans can see, while heartbreak was certainly an important topic in Taylor Swift's new music, her songs are about so much more than that</strong>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirmrGcpL9uv9aina1lnZqur7XNoGSbnZieu6V5zZ6uZqufo7S0ecWapaxlk6S7t7XNnJydZZGXvLbAjKaYraypYrWmrcuyZg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ftaylor-swift-clarifies-meaning-behind-new-songs-as-fans-are-convinced-she-wrote-about-matty-healy.html&text=Taylor%20Swift%20Clarifies%20Meaning%20Behind%20New%20Songs%20As%20Fans%20Are%20Convinced%20She%20Wrote%20About%20Matty%20Healy&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftaylor-swift-clarifies-meaning-behind-new-songs-as-fans-are-convinced-she-wrote-about-matty-healy.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftaylor-swift-clarifies-meaning-behind-new-songs-as-fans-are-convinced-she-wrote-about-matty-healy.html&title=Taylor%20Swift%20Clarifies%20Meaning%20Behind%20New%20Songs%20As%20Fans%20Are%20Convinced%20She%20Wrote%20About%20Matty%20Healy" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ftaylor-swift-clarifies-meaning-behind-new-songs-as-fans-are-convinced-she-wrote-about-matty-healy.html&title=Taylor%20Swift%20Clarifies%20Meaning%20Behind%20New%20Songs%20As%20Fans%20Are%20Convinced%20She%20Wrote%20About%20Matty%20Healy" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ftaylor-swift-clarifies-meaning-behind-new-songs-as-fans-are-convinced-she-wrote-about-matty-healy.html&title=Taylor%20Swift%20Clarifies%20Meaning%20Behind%20New%20Songs%20As%20Fans%20Are%20Convinced%20She%20Wrote%20About%20Matty%20Healy" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftaylor-swift-clarifies-meaning-behind-new-songs-as-fans-are-convinced-she-wrote-about-matty-healy.html&description=Taylor%20Swift%20Clarifies%20Meaning%20Behind%20New%20Songs%20As%20Fans%20Are%20Convinced%20She%20Wrote%20About%20Matty%20Healy" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./the-search-for-13-year-old-twins-missing-on-galveston-island-continues.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Search For 13-year-old Twins Missing On Galveston Island Continues">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./pamela-sue-martin-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Pamela Sue Martin Net Worth">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
