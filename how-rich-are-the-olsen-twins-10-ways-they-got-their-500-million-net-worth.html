Though the twins are super-private, it's no secret that the duo is worth a staggering $500 million. Here&nbsp;are ten ways the notorious Olsen twins earned their net worth.</p><h2 id=early-days-on-full-house><span class=item-num>18 </span><span>Early Days On&nbsp;Full House</span></h2><h2><span class=item-num>17 </span><span></span></h2><p>When Mary-Kate and Ashley were toddlers, they started out making $2,400 per episode on Full House&nbsp;with ABC, notes&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmopolitan</a>. Playing Michelle Tanner was a small role at first, but as the girls grew, so did their income, and that&nbsp;relatively low rate didn't last long. Soon, the tots were given a pay raise that brought them to $25K per episode.</p><p>Eventually, the adorable twins were raking in $80K per episode on the sitcom, and that doesn't include the cash they were earning from their on-the-side films. Not bad for a <a href=#>TV series that lasted for years</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-olsen-film-franchise><span class=item-num>16 </span><span>The Olsen Film Franchise</span></h2><h2><span class=item-num>15 </span><span></span></h2><p>Nineties kids were thrilled when the Olsen twins started releasing their own movies. Movies like&nbsp;The Adventures of Mary-Kate and Ashley&nbsp;(a video series),&nbsp;Sister, Sister, and&nbsp;New York Minute became <a href=#>fan-favorite&nbsp;'90s picks</a>. Of course, they were also lucrative for the Olsen twins.</p><p>In fact, many films were released under the twins' own company, Dualstar, which their parents set up while the girls were still minors. The result was a combined net worth of $100 million by the time the girls reached their 20s.</p><h2 id=a-walmart-clothing-line-and-other-merch><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>A Walmart Clothing Line (And Other Merch)</span></h2><h2><span class=item-num>13 </span><span></span></h2><p>Fans who were tweens in the <a href=#>'90s</a> and early 2000s will remember vividly the Walmart clothing lines from Mary-Kate and Ashley. Of course, the line catered to gals of all ages, starting with preschoolers, and also included&nbsp;a handful of beauty products plastered with the twins' faces.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>15 Movie Cameos That Could Have Only Happened In The '90s</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Knowing what Mary-Kate and Ashley wear now, it's amusing to recall the clothing items found on Walmart racks. Though the Olsen twins are largely boho-chic these days, their clothing line was less mature, though still plenty fun and quirky.</p><h2 id=remember-the-mary-kate-amp-ashley-fan-club><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Remember The Mary-Kate & Ashley Fan Club?</span></h2><h2><span class=item-num>11 </span><span></span></h2><p>Only true nineties kids will remember the existence of the Mary-Kate and Ashley fan club. Technically, it was a "fun club," but the fact remains that the girls had tons of paying customers for their collectibles and photos.</p><p>Along with a Mary-Kate and Ashley magazine, subscribers to the club got catalogs and "gifts" from the twins. Unfortunately for die-hard fans, the club ended in 2000, though old ads can still be seen on the VHS movies from the twins circa the 1990s.</p><h2 id=mattel-versions-of-mary-kate-and-ashley-likely-earned-bank><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Mattel Versions Of Mary-Kate And Ashley Likely Earned Bank</span></h2><h2><span class=item-num>9 </span><span></span></h2><p>Barbie has remained perpetually popular for decades, so it's not surprising that Mattel wanted to get in on the Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen popularity train. Between 2000 and 2005, Mattel produced Mary-Kate and Ashley fashion dolls.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>20 Old McDonald’s Toys From The '90s Worth A Fortune Today</a></span></p><p>It was around this time (2004, to be precise) when Ashley and Mary-Kate turned 18 and fully took over their company. The two are co-presidents of Dualstar, and by 2007, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Forbes </a>was ranking them as the 11th-richest women in the world (they shared the spot). At that point, the twins were worth about $100M.</p><h2 id=fronting-for-badgley-mischka><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Fronting For Badgley Mischka</span></h2><h2><span class=item-num>7 </span><span></span></h2><p>Back in 2006, Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen were featured in Badgley Mischka's spring campaign. At the time, the twins were 19, and just entering the more grown-up phase of their branding.</p><p>Instead of dressing down the way the twins formerly did on red carpets, the pair donned glam dresses, dark lipstick, and smokey eyes for the Badgley Mischka campaign. For fans, at least, the print ads marked a turning point in the girls' careers. After all, by this point, the girls were worth millions.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=couture-fashion-with-the-row><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Couture Fashion With The Row</span></h2><p>As&nbsp;Cosmopolitan&nbsp;explained, Mary-Kate and Ashley launched their fashion line The Row in 2006. Though the pair was relatively new to the fashion industry at that point, the brand earns between $100 and $200 million per year. It seems the brand is what brought the twins to the forefront as fashion designers.</p><p>For a couture brand, that's an impressive contribution to the twins' net worth. And, it's an ongoing amount, unlike the short-term profits from other collabs and product lines the Olsens have sold.</p><h2 id=enter-elizabeth-amp-james-the-clothing-line><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Enter: Elizabeth & James, The Clothing Line</span></h2><h2><span class=item-num>4 </span><span></span></h2><p>Elizabeth and James is the Olsen twins' less luxe clothing&nbsp;brand. It's not as pricey as The Row, but it is named after the Olsens' lesser-known siblings, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">actress Elizabeth Olsen</a> and brother James, AKA Trent.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Regardless, the brand is earning big bucks for the Olsen twins year to year. The estimated annual revenue, per&nbsp;Cosmo, is $89 million. If the twins had to live on that alone, they'd still be able to afford the pricey NY townhouses they call home (at least, Mary-Kate did until her split from Olivier Sarkozy.</p><h2 id=collabs-with-jc-penney><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Collabs With JC Penney</span></h2><h2><span class=item-num>2 </span><span></span></h2><p>In 2009,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Seventeen</a>&nbsp;confirmed that Mary-Kate and Ashley were launching a collab with JC Penney. And at that time, the department store chain was far more happening than it is today. News of the Olsens' line, Olsenboye, excited fans and critics alike.</p><p>The name comes from the Norwegian roots of the twins' last name, and it relied heavily on teen fashion trends and affordable wardrobe items. Tees, hoodies, and plaid were just a few of the line's trademarks, but it was clearly worth the investment for the twins.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mary-kate-and-ashley-published-a-book-too><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Mary-Kate And Ashley Published A Book, Too</span></h2><p>Fangirls of Mary-Kate and Ashley remember the many books the girls published during their tween and teen fame. Titles like&nbsp;Our Story: The Official Biography&nbsp;were big picks at Scholastic book fairs of the early 2000s.</p><p>But it was&nbsp;Influence that garnered the Olsen twins more attention in 2008. The book featured interviews with fashion influencers like Diane von Furstenberg, Karl Lagerfield, Lauren Hutton, and more, and it likely added a few more dollars to the Olsen twins' overall net worth.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>15 Kids' Shows From The 90s That Would Never Fly Today</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGimpauVYsG4tc2sZKedpGLEsL7ToWShp6diwamx2GakmpyVYrqwusSyZg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fhow-rich-are-the-olsen-twins-10-ways-they-got-their-500-million-net-worth.html&text=How%20Rich%20Are%20The%20Olsen%20Twins%3f%2010%20Ways%20They%20Got%20Their%20%24500%20Million%20Net%20Worth&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhow-rich-are-the-olsen-twins-10-ways-they-got-their-500-million-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhow-rich-are-the-olsen-twins-10-ways-they-got-their-500-million-net-worth.html&title=How%20Rich%20Are%20The%20Olsen%20Twins%3f%2010%20Ways%20They%20Got%20Their%20%24500%20Million%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fhow-rich-are-the-olsen-twins-10-ways-they-got-their-500-million-net-worth.html&title=How%20Rich%20Are%20The%20Olsen%20Twins%3f%2010%20Ways%20They%20Got%20Their%20%24500%20Million%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fhow-rich-are-the-olsen-twins-10-ways-they-got-their-500-million-net-worth.html&title=How%20Rich%20Are%20The%20Olsen%20Twins%3f%2010%20Ways%20They%20Got%20Their%20%24500%20Million%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhow-rich-are-the-olsen-twins-10-ways-they-got-their-500-million-net-worth.html&description=How%20Rich%20Are%20The%20Olsen%20Twins%3f%2010%20Ways%20They%20Got%20Their%20%24500%20Million%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./how-to-reset-isc-touch-250.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How to reset isc touch 250">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./how-much-was-cillian-murphy-paid-to-play-tommy-shelby.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How Much Was Cillian Murphy Paid To Play Tommy Shelby?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
