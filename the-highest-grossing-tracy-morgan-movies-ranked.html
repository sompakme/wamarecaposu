Born as Tracy Jamal Morgan in one of the toughest parts of the Brooklyn borough, Bedford Stuyvesant, in 1968, he endured a season of tribulation before making his television debut in 1994 on the Fox comedy sitcom, Martin, starring fellow<a href=#> comedian superstar Martin Lawrence.</a></p><p>He also became a regular on the sketch-comedy show, Uptown Comedy Club, as well as on Def Comedy Jam and Saturday Night Live before his film career took off. Since then, he has starred alongside <a href=#>heavyweight actors such as Chris Rock</a>, Katt Williams, rapper/actor Ice Cube, Shawn and Marlon Wayans, Dave Chapelle, Regina King, and Bruce Willis.

Honestly, it's rare that an actor can ever lose when doing a movie for children. This proved to be true a second time for Morgan with his reprised role in 2014 <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">3D computer-animated musical comedy, Rio 2</a>. The second installment continues to follow the Spix's macaw named Blu, <a href=#>played by actor Jesse Eisenberg</a>, and his mate, Jewel, played by Anne Hathaway, who live in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The couple now has three children - Carla, Bia, and Tiago. Other main actors include Leslie Mann, Rodrigo Santoro, and George Lopez, R&B/pop singer Bruno Mars, and Tracy Morgan. The film grossed $492.846 million at the box office.</p><h2 id=rio---487-519-million>Rio - $487.519 Million</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Rio is the first installment of the 3D computer-animated comedy film franchise and was released in 2011. The title of the movie is taken from the Brazilian city of Rio de Janeiro, which is also the setting for the film. The film features many of the actors that were mentioned in Rio 2 such as Jesse Einstein, who plays the main character Blu, and<a href=#> Leslie Mann</a>, who is seen to be the child who found Blu while he was being smuggled from Brazil to the United States. Blu is a male Spix's macaw and is a rare, exotic bird. Fifteen years after being found by Linda, they are invited by Brazilian ornithologist, Tulio (Rodrigo Santoro), to come to Rio de Janeiro to mate with the last known female Spix's macaw, Jewel (Anne Hathaway). The only thing is, Blu can't fly. The film grossed $487.519 million globally and also featured the voices of<a href=#> rapper will.i.am</a>, Jamie Foxx, and Tracy Morgan.</p><h2 id=g-force---292-817-million>G-Force - $292.817 Million</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Produced by Walt Disney Pictures, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">G-Force is a spy adventure-comedy film</a> that was released in 2009 and follows a highly specialized team of trained animals.

But there are times when a role requires an actor to go to the extreme when it comes to getting into character, like Jim Carrey in The Cable Guy. Released in 2005, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Longest Yard </a>is a sports comedy film that was a remake of the 1974 version starring the late <a href=#>legendary actor Burt Reynolds.</a></p><p>It follows a washed-up professional NFL quarterback named Paul Crewe (Adam Sandler) who is sentenced to three years in prison after getting drunk and joy riding his girlfriend's Bentley through San Diego.

We've seem it in movies like Meet The Fockers and Zoolander with <a href=#>Owen Wilson and Ben Stiller</a> and Death at a Funeral with a cast of actors such as Danny Glover, Kevin Hart, Martin Lawrence, Chris Rock, and Luke Wilson. The 2006 comedy, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Little Man</a>, is also one such film. The film features Marlon and Shawn Wayans as the main actors who co-star with Kerry Washington, <a href=#>the late comedy powerhouse John Witherspoon</a>, and Molly Shannon. Tracy Morgan played the role of a dimwitted robbery accomplice named Percy. But despite its commercial success of grossing $101.636 million at the box office, the film received largely negative reviews from critics.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=are-we-there-yet---98-114-million>Are We There Yet? - $98.114 Million</h2><p>Are We There Yet wouldn't be the first only movie Tracy Morgan and Ice Cube co-starred in together that was a commercial success.
