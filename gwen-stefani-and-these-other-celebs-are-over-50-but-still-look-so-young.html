These 15 celebs have more than half a century behind them, but we don't think they wear their ages on their faces. And it isn't like they've all stayed in peak physical condition, either, as some of those&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">pro athletes that just don't age</a>&nbsp;have. Many stars on this list have basically normal body types and have somehow captured the secret of looking youthful.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Some of them wear their decades a little bit more gracefully than others, but when it comes to growing old, the smartest celebs embrace the process.</p><p>"The term 'anti-aging' makes me crazy," Jamie Lee Curtis declared in a Huffington Post interview. "There are plenty of other things to be anti about. Anti-discrimination. Anti-drug. Anti-oppression. Anti-poverty and sickness. Aging is human evolution in its pure form."</p><p>Jamie Lee is 62 years old. Next year, Winona Ryder, Naomi Campbell, and <a href=#>Michelle Williams from Destiny's Child</a>&nbsp;will join her in the 'over 50' club. Where has the time gone? For now, here are the stars we wouldn't have guessed are already 50+.</p><h2 id=gwen-stefani><span class=item-num>16 </span><span>Gwen Stefani</span></h2><p>There's a reason <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gwen Stefani looks so good</a> for her age. When she was asked about it around her 50th birthday last year, Gwen told Elle that she's been focused on taking care of her skin since her early 20s. Her best tip? "The key is to keep your face clean at night. Let your face breathe (because I really don't let it breathe at any other time)."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=keanu-reeves><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>Keanu Reeves</span></h2><p>You might not guess it by looking at him, but Keanu Reeves is 55 and feeling it. "F***ing mortality. Ageing. I’m just starting to get better at it," he admitted to Esquire. "Just the amount of stuff you have to do before you’re dead. I’m all of the clichés. Oh my God. OK. Where did the time go? How come things are changing?" Hang in there, Keanu! You look great.</p><h2 id=lisa-kudrow-the-women-of-friends><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Lisa Kudrow (+ The Women Of Friends)</span></h2><p>This pic from Courteney Cox's IG shows the women of Friends as they look today; they are definitely all grown up. Lisa Kudrow is 56, making her the oldest member of the show's core cast. Courteney is 55 and Jennifer Aniston is 51. For the record, the youngest 'friend'&nbsp;is actually Matthew Perry, who is 50. Could Chandler BE any luckier to know these fine older ladies?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lisa-bonet><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Lisa Bonet</span></h2><p>Lisa Bonet's been cooler than the rest of us since her breakout role on The Cosby Show, where she played the beautiful eldest daughter, Denise Huxtable. Now she has a gorgeous daughter of her own and still looks fierce. Her anti-aging regimen is all about natural ingredients. "I was using coconut oil before the current craze," she told&nbsp;The New York Times. "It’s simple and pure."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Times We Could Hardly Tell Lisa Bonet And Zoë Kravitz Apart</a></span></p><h2 id=ellen-pompeo><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Ellen Pompeo</span></h2><p>Ellen Pompeo turned 50 in November 2019. Her age actually kept her on Grey's Anatomy, despite the toxic work environment. "My decision to stay on was based solely on age. At 33, I was wise enough to know my clock was already ticking in Hollywood," she told Entertainment Weekly. And it wasn’t easy: "Watching myself age on TV is miserable. To be honest, it’s the toughest part of my job."</p><h2 id=jay-z><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Jay-Z</span></h2><p>When Jay-Z turned 50, he marked the occasion in true rap legend style. Not only did he party with friends like Kanye West and DJ Khaled, but he also released his entire discography for the public to stream (it had previously only been available on Tidal). Even Drake got in the spirit, alone in his megamansion, by playing "Hov in the house all day," as he shared via an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">IG story</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Surprisingly Sweet Things Jay-Z Has Done</a></span></p><h2 id=diddy><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Diddy</span></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Diddy's net worth</a> grows by the day. He dropped a few million at an epic 50th birthday bash in December 2019. The invite was an audio message from Naomi Cambell, saying "You’re invited to Diddy 50… only come with dancing shoes and good vibes," according to Page Six. Celebrity guests included Kevin Hart, Wiz Khalifa, Queen Latifah, Tracey Ellis Ross, Taraji P. Henson, Jermaine Dupri, Usher, and Post Malone.</p><h2 id=jennifer-lopez><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Jennifer Lopez</span></h2><p>J.Lo knows she looks good for 50. "The number one tip is to always get enough sleep. I can't stress this enough," she told InStyle in 2018. "I always make sure I get at least eight." We can't all look this good just by sleeping, though. "I have to say I have good genes. My mom and my grandma had beautiful skin, so I was blessed with that. I'm fortunate."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=owen-wilson><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Owen Wilson</span></h2><p>While promoting Zoolander 2,&nbsp;Owen spoke about how obsessed people can get with looking young. "You see a lot of that in Beverly Hills for sure. I don't know I guess it's like people sort of can lose themselves and it becomes sort of an addiction," he explained. When she asked if he or Ben Stiller had any work done, he joked that they didn't need to. "We're very lucky."</p><h2 id=naomi-watts><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Naomi Watts</span></h2><p>Naomi Watts will turn 52 in 2020. She's doing all she can to age gracefully. "A<span>s I get older I’m determined to take care of my skin," Naomi explained in an IG caption. "I use so MUCH make up for my work, under hot lights, with multiple applications day after day... so I’m always trying new products/facials to find the best ones that are cleansing and healing for me."</span></p><h2 id=marilyn-manson><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Marilyn Manson</span></h2><p>Marilyn Manson is 51 and his music is maturing right along with the rest of him. According to The Guardian, Marilyn's most recent album is less gory/more self-reflective, inspired by his mother passing away. "It’s about like passing on your legacy," he explained. "You know, I’m the last man in the family, because I don’t have any siblings. So yeah, that is something that I actually have been thinking about."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=dave-bautista><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Dave Bautista</span></h2><p>While he's an actor now, Dave Bautista launched himself into the spotlight with a career in mixed martial arts and bodybuilding. His time as a pro wrestler helped him develop the massive and intimidating bod he showed off in the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise. It's just makeup, not prosthetics! This huge dude might be over 50 but we still wouldn't pick a fight with him.</p><h2 id=minnie-driver><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Minnie Driver</span></h2><p>Minnie Driver has strong opinions about aging as a woman. "Sick of this '50 is the new...'" she tweeted in February 2020. "50 has always been 50. Women were previously just expected to shrivel and accept their husk. I suppose it must be terrifying to a lot of men if we actually burned brighter, hotter, more ambitious and emancipated from shame, the older we got. #50"</p><h2 id=chaz-bono><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Chaz Bono</span></h2><p>Cher's only child is 51 (Cher herself is pushing 74) and we can't believe how fast things change. He seems happy to be aging as he is. Fun fact: in 2011, a tabloid published false information about him dying. Chaz's lawyer sent them a cease and desist letter, cause obvs, this man is very much alive.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=catherine-zeta-jones><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Catherine Zeta-Jones</span></h2><p>Catherine Zeta-Jones is a gorgeous actress, but feels like her time in the spotlight is done. "I think it's a natural progression. I'm going to play more mums than sex symbols. That's a gradual thing for me because I'm too old to play younger characters." She's still young compared to her husband, though. While Catherine is 51 this year, hubby Michael Douglas is 75 years old.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sofia Richie And 14 Others Dating Celeb Men Who Are Much Older</a></span></p><h2 id=tony-hawk><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Tony Hawk</span></h2><p>When Tony turned 50 in May 2018, he marked the occasion with an extra special video for his fans. He did what he does best and pulled out FIFTY back to back skate tricks in front of the camera. "Thanks to all of you that made this dream possible," he said. "It’s been an unreal ride, but I’m not done yet." So cool! No wonder Ellen is friends with him<span class=next-single>.</span></p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">8 Big Bang Theory Stars That Are Older Than We Think (And 7 Younger)</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Sources</strong>: Insider.com, Elle.co.uk, Esquire.com, Metro.co.uk, EW.com, PageSix.com, HelloBeautiful.com, InStyle.com, YouTube.com, TheGuardian.com, FTW.USAtoday.com, HuffPost.com, Edition.CNN.com, RedOnline.co.uk</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiesJ2eYsC1scWapaJlkaOxbsDHnqqeZZ%2Bptaa%2BjJycpZ2SqHqivsRmpq%2BdomKCcXnBrqtmq6Seua15y6impGWjpHq6u9Snnmg%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fgwen-stefani-and-these-other-celebs-are-over-50-but-still-look-so-young.html&text=Gwen%20Stefani%20And%20These%20Other%20Celebs%20Are%20Over%2050%2c%20But%20Still%20Look%20So%20Young&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fgwen-stefani-and-these-other-celebs-are-over-50-but-still-look-so-young.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fgwen-stefani-and-these-other-celebs-are-over-50-but-still-look-so-young.html&title=Gwen%20Stefani%20And%20These%20Other%20Celebs%20Are%20Over%2050%2c%20But%20Still%20Look%20So%20Young" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fgwen-stefani-and-these-other-celebs-are-over-50-but-still-look-so-young.html&title=Gwen%20Stefani%20And%20These%20Other%20Celebs%20Are%20Over%2050%2c%20But%20Still%20Look%20So%20Young" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fgwen-stefani-and-these-other-celebs-are-over-50-but-still-look-so-young.html&title=Gwen%20Stefani%20And%20These%20Other%20Celebs%20Are%20Over%2050%2c%20But%20Still%20Look%20So%20Young" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fgwen-stefani-and-these-other-celebs-are-over-50-but-still-look-so-young.html&description=Gwen%20Stefani%20And%20These%20Other%20Celebs%20Are%20Over%2050%2c%20But%20Still%20Look%20So%20Young" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./here-s-how-cameron-diaz-earns-and-spends-her-140-million-fortune.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Here's How Cameron Diaz Earns And Spends Her $140 Million Fortune">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./a-closer-look-at-a-ap-rocky-s-business-genius.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="A Closer Look At A$AP Rocky's Business Genius">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
