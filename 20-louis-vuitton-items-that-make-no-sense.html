Nobody can really pronounce it (except the French), but Louis Vuitton is a status symbol – that isn't up for debate. The luggage giant has been accompanying the rich and famous on their shopping sprees, private jets, dinner dates, Instagram accounts, and more. Just last month, Ariana Grande stepped out in a Louis Vuitton monogrammed skirt and matching cat ears. It's hard to estimate what percentage of Kylie Jenner's closet is Louis Vuitton, but we'll assume it's a sizeable amount. As celebs replace bodyguard entourages with the iconic monogrammed leathers, the brand just keeps climbing. It's expensive, hand-made, fancy, and, wait... sometimes completely wrong?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Owning a Louis Vuitton purse is something most regular people dream of. A fair amount of us are putting our hard-earned cash towards actually purchasing one, and when we do, we cherish it. Why? Because it represents everything we wish our lives could be&nbsp;– luxurious. While the purses, suitcases, shades, shoes, wallets, and umbrellas might be in keeping with the "Louis Vuitton luxe," something strange has happened. The obsession with all things LV has gone too far. Items that should never, ever be monogrammed are being paraded around in broad daylight, and it is not the best look. From the bizarre household items to the OTT alterations that have to be seen to be believed, here are 20 Louis Vuitton items that literally make no sense.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=a-questionable-take-on-luxury><strong>A QUESTIONABLE TAKE ON LUXURY</strong></h2><p>Of all the things we would expect Kim Kardashian to have monogrammed,&nbsp;garbage cans aren't one of them. Kim received a pretty&nbsp;surprised reaction in 2018 when she took to social media to pose with what appeared to be Louis Vuitton trash cans. Some fans weren't surprised – Kim did, after all, give North West a $50,000 purse to paint, according to People. The reality star does have a sense of humor, though – this Snapchat was a good example of it. Of course, LV fanatics were quick to replace their own trash cans with fancier, Louis Vuitton ones. Fans wondered whether Kim K even takes out the trash. If she does, she's doing it in style.</p><h2 id=halloween-just-got-pricey><strong>HALLOWEEN JUST GOT PRICEY</strong></h2><p>While Louis Vuitton did bring out a limited edition Yayoi Kusama x Louis Vuitton Pumpkin Bag, this LV obsessive's version is kind of excessive. If you're wondering where the brand's iconic monogram started, it goes way back to the year 1896 – it was an attempt to fight counterfeits. Considering how many not-so-genuine Louis Vuitton bags are out there, we're wondering if that backfired a little. Fortunately, the pumpkin is pretty unique – in the kind of way that no-one would ever want to copy. Oprah once said, "I used to have a fake Louis Vuitton bag because I thought it meant something in life."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=only-in-beverly-hills><strong>ONLY IN BEVERLY HILLS</strong></h2><p>Where&nbsp;do we even start with this one? Louis Vuitton has struggled as a brand in recent years. Not because sales are dwindling. Because too many "regular" people are buying their goods (and the luxury edge might not be so "luxury" anymore). Louis Vuitton isn't the only high-end designer to have suffered this way. Burberry had to remove their entire Nova Check range when too many street kids skateboarding around in Burberry caps were "damaging the brand." This luxury set of wheels once had class. Splattered with the Louis Vuitton monogram? Not so much, anymore. We're praying the people at Louis Vuitton never see this one.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=keep-it-real-kids><strong>KEEP IT REAL, KIDS</strong></h2><p>People sit on two sides of the fence when it comes to designer kidswear. There are those who love it: "What? It's just given me endless new ways to accessorize my entire life!" Then there are the more realistic types – there's a limit to what's reasonable. Celebrities will inevitably dress their little bundles of joy in the nicest clothes that money can buy. When it's regular school kids rocking up to preschool in $1300 rucksacks, "keeping it real" may need some work. Then again, when you're inspired by celebrity quotes... Lady Gaga recently described her hair as "Louis Vuitton brown."</p><h2 id=when-people-get-a-little-too-dedicated><strong>WHEN PEOPLE GET A LITTLE TOO DEDICATED</strong></h2><p>Yes, this guy is for real. "L.V. Bandit" is an Instagram account dedicated to this man's unwavering and unbeatable love of Louis Vuitton. While the brand has the latest kicks (thanks to its uber-hip new artistic director, Virgil Abloh), we're wondering what Virgil would make of this guy. The account "@lv.bdandit" has everything from monogrammed backgrounds for his Tupac Shakur pics to white monogrammed roses that are... well, pretty random. Presumably, he is following the celeb loyalty, which is, itself, endless. Leighton Meester, Rihanna, Miley Cyrus, Anne Hathaway, and every Kardashian around are all huge fans. Emma Stone is currently the face of the brand.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=when-regular-bathrooms-just-don-t-cut-it><strong>WHEN REGULAR BATHROOMS JUST DON'T CUT IT</strong></h2><p>Decking out your wardrobe in Louis Vuitton can be forgiven.&nbsp;Huge fans are way beyond limiting it to the odd purse or iPhone case, though. We're seeing airports with Louis Vuitton check-in and carry-on luggage – and that's before you look at the actual person. If they're the ultimate Louis Vuitton fan, they'll complete their look while they're there. We're talking about arriving in LV shades, belts, jackets, and shoes, then topping the look up by dropping into the airport's Louis Vuitton store. For those who simply cannot bear to limit their adoration to accessories, there's always this. Getting a #dedicated bathroom that's above the rest, here is Louis Vuitton making zero sense.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=all-the-times-you-needed-louis-vuitton-music><strong>ALL THE TIMES YOU NEEDED LOUIS VUITTON MUSIC</strong></h2><p>Of all the luxury brands out there, Louis Vuitton wins when it comes to musical mentions. Something about the hip-hop world's love of luxury goods just fits right in with Louis Vuitton, and the honorary mentions are endless. Jay-Z has rapped about the brand. Kanye West has done it 19 times. "I'm caught up in the moment, right? This is Louis Vuitton Don night." From Big Sean to Nicki Minaj, every artist out there is dropping the designer's name. Most of them are also wearing it. In 2017, Drake made a song just for Louis Vuitton. Kanye West has mentioned Louis Vuitton 19 times in total.</p><h2 id=because-dogs-totally-care-about-this><strong>BECAUSE DOGS TOTALLY CARE ABOUT THIS</strong></h2><p>This isn't far off what Louis Vuitton actually sells. Their Baxter Dog Collar PM Monogram Canvas retails for a staggering $264 – just for a small dog collar. Of course, when you're into material possessions as a status symbol, you're not doing it right until you have a little pooch to carry around. Paris Hilton is arguably the founder of the chihuahua "accessory," and she isn't the only one to spoil her pets. If you really can't live without Louis Vuitton accessorizing your entire life, there's always this dog coat. Still, a Louis Vuitton-monogrammed animal coat that will likely only get covered in mud. Really? Does that say "class?"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=whatever-happened-to-less-is-more><strong>WHATEVER HAPPENED TO LESS IS MORE?</strong></h2><p>In 2010, Paris Hilton took herself and the entirety of Louis Vuitton to the soccer World Cup. The heiress and socialite is well-known for her love of all things luxury, like her pink Bentley. The difference is, with the car, she only has one. She actually owns dozens of pieces of Louis Vuitton luggage. Something about this almost says: "I love money" more than "I love Louis Vuitton." It's when you break down how much this small mountain of Louis Vuitton armor is worth that your brain starts to hurt. Not counting customizations, you're looking at $7,000 for a trunk and a good $1,500 minimum for smaller bags. Owning the lot? Kind of defying the point of "rare luxury goods."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=when-a-regular-band-aid-isn-t-enough><strong>WHEN A REGULAR BAND-AID ISN'T ENOUGH</strong></h2><p>2016 was an interesting year. You can't accuse Louis Vuitton of not being creative here, but there's a fine line between creative and nonsensical. The 2016 Louis Vuitton Cruise campaign was definitely full of color – pink-haired models on the runway was one way of adding a splash of color to brown leather. Coming up with Louis Vuitton band-aids for the poster? We'll leave you to come to your own conclusions for that one. They're definitely monogrammed, though. Presumably, a solution for any accidents using Louis Vuitton's homeware.</p><p><strong>Louis Vuitton Band-aids? Clearly for people who love the brand so much, it hurts.</strong></p><h2 id=the-louis-vuitton-trash-bag><strong>THE LOUIS VUITTON TRASH BAG</strong></h2><p>Well, if you're going to use Louis Vuitton trash cans... It's stuff like this that makes us re-examine the meaning of the Louis Vuitton monogram. Since you clicked on this because, in some way, you identify with the brand, here are some neat facts. The first monogram appeared in 1896. By the 1950s and 60s, women around the world were traveling with their monogrammed luggage. There was also that awkward Dapper Dan knock-off moment in the 90s. Things continued onwards and upwards&nbsp;when Marc Jacobs became the creative director in 1997. Then came the colors and the funky Takashi Muramaki white backgrounds. Now? Well, there's this trash bag.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=your-kid-could-make-this-in-arts-and-crafts><strong>YOUR KID COULD MAKE THIS IN ARTS AND CRAFTS</strong></h2><p>Louis Vuitton is definitely a matter of taste. For some, the more monogrammed material, the better. For others, it's something to use sparingly. The vibe was definitely leaning towards the first at the 2019 Louis Vuitton Menswear collection. The uber-hip designer Virgil Abloh was appointed creative director in March 2018. While he has definitely channeled trends like perspex, plastic, and sneakers, this oversized bag sort of finds itself in the "what?" pile. It's got its own chic, but at the same time, you can't help but wonder if this is something a creatively gifted five-year-old could come up with in arts and crafts. Maybe appoint that child as the next director?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=well-they-are-called-fashion-houses><strong>WELL, THEY ARE CALLED FASHION HOUSES</strong></h2><p>French fashion houses do have the "maison" name – that means "house" in French. You've got the actual brand, Maison Margiela, but all the greats refer to themselves that way. Givenchy, Chanel, Dior, and Saint Laurent are all a "maison" in French. The verdict is definitely out on what Louis Vuitton would think of this Mexican setup, though. Aside from a brief moment of thinking, "Nice, you dig us," we'll assume that Virgil Abloh would be hashtagging this with one giant #eyeroll. For something similar and a little more tasteful, there is the Charlotte Perriant Beachhouse in Miami. It isn't monogrammed, but it is designed in partnership with Louis Vuitton.</p><h2 id=when-breakfast-needs-some-inspiration><strong>WHEN BREAKFAST NEEDS SOME INSPIRATION</strong></h2><p>Sure, toast is "in" in the millennial way that has millions of us&nbsp;posting photos of our morning smashed avocado. Someone clearly went to a lot of effort to create this Louis Vuitton toast. Admit it, it makes no sense. Then again, Louis Vuitton has a way of popping up all over the place.</p><p><strong>Remember Mean Girls? They were carrying around Louis Vuitton purses.</strong></p><p>It's unlikely that any other brand has made such an influence in Hollywood. Remember Jennifer Hudson in SATC? Carrie gave her a Louis Vuitton purse. It made her year. The toast? It's on this list for a reason.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-100-000-louis-vuitton-toilet><strong>THE $100,000 LOUIS VUITTON TOILET</strong></h2><p>Well, it's definitely one way of showing brand loyalty. This is the Loo-Uis Vuitton Toilet. Made by the artist Illma Gore for the luxury resale platform Tradesy, this designer throne is covered in $15,000 worth of monogrammed leather ripped from Louis Vuitton bags. Everything but the inside of the bowl — which is gold — is covered in the iconic monogrammed leather. Call it an April Fool's all you like. It's real. Louis Vuitton themselves don't retail this gem, although they definitely have some questionably high-priced everyday items. Their ping-pong bat retails for over $1000. Still, at least they aren't a toilet.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=when-you-need-to-express-a-love-of-leather-through-cake><strong>WHEN YOU NEED TO EXPRESS A LOVE OF LEATHER THROUGH CAKE</strong></h2><p>Novelty cakes are awesome – within limits. When your three year-old lives for Finding Nemo, you get them a Nemo cake. If you're dating someone whose last relationship was with the soccer World Cup, you get them a fitting cake (possibly with a miniature David Beckham). What makes no sense about this is the money it would cost. Novelty cakes cost a fortune. Between the planning, design, ingredients, delivery, and inevitable waste, you could almost have bought yourself a small Louis Vuitton item, like a dangly charm for the oh-so-reasonable price of $190, or those pencils they sell at around $130 for two.</p><h2 id=calling-all-time-strapped-moms><strong>CALLING ALL TIME-STRAPPED MOMS</strong></h2><p>Great – the symbol of unattainable luxury and celebrity is now available for the thing you use to wipe down your sink. Let's just get the "luxury" status clarified. All Louis Vuitton bags are hand-made. According to All Things Luxury, after every season, any unsold Louis Vuitton goods are sent back to the factory in France and shredded or burned to sustain the item's value and maintain the brand's class. If that's a concept you aspire to, by all means, spend your hard-earned cash on a Louis Vuitton Damier Ebene. Just don't use one of these.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Louis Vuitton actually shreds or burns its unsold bags – to maintain the brand's classy edge.</strong></p><h2 id=the-rich-kid-who-needs-a-reality-check><strong>THE RICH KID WHO NEEDS A REALITY CHECK</strong></h2><p>Ah, the Rich Kids of Instagram. It's time to meet the&nbsp;15 year-old Dubai Instagram sensation, Rashed Belhasa. He goes by his more-appropriate moniker of Money Kicks, and yes, he's got plenty of it. Alongside owning 50 pet lions, this teen drops $5000 a month on streetwear, according to SharpMagazine. That's nothing compared to the half a million dollars Rashed dropped to have his Ferrari F12 Berlinetta covered in a Supreme x Louis Vuitton monogram wrap. Owning a sweet set of wheels is one thing. Those $400,000 Lamborghini Aventadors are like cupcake purchases for celebs like Kanye West or Justin Bieber. You don't see them monogramming their wheels in Louis Vuitton, though.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=do-rich-people-do-their-own-ironing><strong>DO RICH PEOPLE DO THEIR OWN IRONING?</strong></h2><p>This one literally makes no sense. Think of the first person who pops into your head when you think of "mega-rich." The $97 million Drake raked in over 2017? Beyonce and Jay-Z's joint $1.16 billion net worth? Even if it's just the rich dude in your area. If there's one thing wealthy people generally get a maid to do, it's their ironing. While a Louis Vuitton steam iron is definitely up there with the creative things you can wind up having monogrammed, it isn't the most logical. Congratulations, you're rich enough to monogram your own iron. For what? If it's to watch someone else do your ironing, that's a little bit depressing.</p><h2 id=if-you-ve-got-louis-vuitton-taste-buds><strong>IF YOU'VE GOT LOUIS VUITTON TASTE BUDS</strong></h2><p>We're not in the business of judging people, but we did feel a little sad on discovering that someone had gone this far to make their mom's 60th birthday party "a success." Louis Vuitton themselves do not produce candy bars, but fans will get what they want. Regular chocolate can be packaged up with Louis Vuitton packaging for more money than we'd like to imagine. The worst part? It's unlikely that any celebrity would be buying this. It's a regular, hard-working person dropping a ton of cash for chocolate bars with packaging that will likely end up in the trash.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Candy bars with disposable Louis Vuitton packaging? Oh, wait. Handy for using those Louis Vuitton garbage&nbsp;bags.</strong></p><p>For the sheer LOLs, this needs to get out. Whether your Facebook friends are fashionistas, Louis Vuitton lovers, or the exact opposite – people who&nbsp;dislike overdone luxury&nbsp;– hit share.
