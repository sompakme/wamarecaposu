He donned a peach-colored silk button up and a black suit for the occasion.</p><p>While Alwyn has largely stayed out of the spotlight since <a href=#>parting ways with Swift</a>, he‚Äôs been working on a number of acting projects, meaning he could soon be thrust into promotional appearances.</p><p>Alwyn appears in the upcoming<strong> Yorgos Lanthimos</strong> film Kinds of Kindness along with <strong>Emma Stone</strong> and <strong>Margaret Qualley</strong>, who are both friends with Swift. A release date for the project has not been announced, but filming wrapped in December 2022.</p><p>Alwyn and Qualley, 29, who is married to Swift‚Äôs frequent collaborator <strong>Jack Antonoff</strong>, previously shared the screen in the 2022 romantic thriller Stars at Noon, which featured steamy sex scenes between the pair. When Qualley and Antonoff, 39, tied the knot in August 2023, <a href=#>Swift was present</a> while Alwyn was seemingly absent from the New Jersey event.</p><p>In addition to Kinds of Kindness, Alwyn has two other films that are currently in post-production, The Brutalist and Hamlet, as well as a miniseries currently in development, Brideshead Revisited.</p><p>Alwyn‚Äôs Brutalist costar <strong>Emma Laird</strong> <a href=#>shared an Instagram snap of Alwyn</a> in April 2023, shortly after his split from Swift.</p><p>‚ÄúMoments in March‚ù§Ô∏èüé•,‚Äù Laird, 25, captioned the carousel of photos, which included a shot of Alwyn on an e-scooter.</p><p>Alwyn has shared precious few social media posts of his own in recent months. While the actor was never one to post moments with Swift during their relationship, he didn‚Äôt return to Instagram until five months after their breakup.</p><p>In September 2023, he shared a carousel of photos including a snap of himself in a black T-shirt and shades, a throwback childhood picture and a shot of the ocean through a window.</p><p>Alwyn waited another five months before posting another photo dump earlier this month, which included some moody black and white shots, a snap of himself and <strong>Brian Cox</strong> and a <strong>Ricky Gervais</strong> meme.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>While Alwyn‚Äôs posts have been few and far between, he is still following Taylor on Instagram, as well as her brother, <strong>Austin Swift</strong>, and several of her pals, including <strong>Gigi Hadid</strong> and <strong>Ryan Reynolds</strong>.</p><p>Joe‚Äôs latest Instagram upload marked his first post since Swift announced her upcoming 11th studio album, <a href=#>The Tortured Poets Department</a>, which fans think could provide insight into the twosome‚Äôs split. The record is due out April 19.</p><p>Whatever revelations The Tortured Poets Department might contain, it‚Äôs unlikely that Alwyn will tell his side of the story any time soon, if ever. He seems committed to ‚Äúwalking with his head down,‚Äù even though Taylor is no longer the one he‚Äôs walking to.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGawoJGpequ7xGaYpa%2Bpo3qprdJmmZ6dnmLCsXnTqGSsoZ6Ysm60yKxkrKicnsFustGopGaska65sL6MrK6inqRk</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-joe-alwyn-has-been-up-to-since-his-split-from-taylor-swift.html&text=What%20Joe%20Alwyn%20Has%20Been%20Up%20to%20Since%20His%20Split%20From%20Taylor%20Swift&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-joe-alwyn-has-been-up-to-since-his-split-from-taylor-swift.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-joe-alwyn-has-been-up-to-since-his-split-from-taylor-swift.html&title=What%20Joe%20Alwyn%20Has%20Been%20Up%20to%20Since%20His%20Split%20From%20Taylor%20Swift" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-joe-alwyn-has-been-up-to-since-his-split-from-taylor-swift.html&title=What%20Joe%20Alwyn%20Has%20Been%20Up%20to%20Since%20His%20Split%20From%20Taylor%20Swift" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-joe-alwyn-has-been-up-to-since-his-split-from-taylor-swift.html&title=What%20Joe%20Alwyn%20Has%20Been%20Up%20to%20Since%20His%20Split%20From%20Taylor%20Swift" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-joe-alwyn-has-been-up-to-since-his-split-from-taylor-swift.html&description=What%20Joe%20Alwyn%20Has%20Been%20Up%20to%20Since%20His%20Split%20From%20Taylor%20Swift" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-lil-hunter-kelly-everything-to-know-about-the-comedian.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Lil Hunter Kelly?
